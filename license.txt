Phoenix Source Code
===================
Copyright (c) 1991-2007 by Dieter Geiû and JÅrgen Geiû

The development of Phoenix is finished. Of course there are things that
would be nice to have or there are some bugs, but I simply do not have
enough time to implement them. So, if you are missing a feature or you want
a bug fix, you can do it yourself now.

If you create a new Phoenix version, please do not distribute it under my
name. Still, all Phoenix distributions must have the copyright notice
"Phoenix copyright (c) 1991-2007 by Dieter Geiû and JÅrgen Geiû". Your
additions must be free of copyright, or the owner of the copyright must have
granted the release of the source code and the free distribution of the
compiled version.

The source code is provided "as is" without any warranty.
