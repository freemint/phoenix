 1.1.1  About Manager



@endnode





@node "About Manager"

@toc "MANAGER menu"

@xref "About PHOENIX"

@{U}1.1.1  About Manager                                   PHOENIX Manager@{u}



Activating this menu entry brings up a dialog-box showing the authors

who created and translated the program. Clicking on the @{B}@{Info ignore}...@{b} box

provides some further information about its development.



@{B}The purpose of Manager@{b}



The Manager program serves for the acquisition and evaluation of data

of a database. Such a database must have been created beforehand with

the @{Designer ignore} program.



In detail, you can perform the following tasks in Manager:



   ˘ Input of data records

   ˘ Modification of data records

   ˘ Deletion of data records

   ˘ Searching of data records

   ˘ Retrieval of data records

   ˘ Display of data records in table form (as a list)

   ˘ Display of data records in mask form

   ˘ Output of tables to a file

   ˘ Printing of tables

   ˘ Exporting of data records

   ˘ Importing of data records

   ˘ Creation and evaluation of queries

   ˘ Sorting of tables

   ˘ Creation and output of reports and templates

   ˘ Automatic calculation of data

   ˘ Setting and modifying the password

   ˘ Display of information about the database, table or indices

   ˘ Launching @{Designer ignore}

   ˘ Data exchange via the GEM-clipboard

   ˘ Setting of various system parameters



The tasks listed above can be performed individually, but to a large

extent also simultaneously in parallel. A multitasking kernel has

been implemented in the Manager which makes it possible to perform

all longer-lasting operations in the background. Up to six such

processes, also called tasks, can run in parallel. This makes it

possible, for instance, to print out a long list from a table while

searching for the address of a contact in another table (of any

database) so that you can contact him.



@{B}Launching the Manager@{b}

The Manager is started by double-clicking on the MANAGER.PRG icon or

filename. At launch the following files should be present on the

floppy disk or hard drive partition:

- MANAGER.PRG

- MANAGER.RSC

- MANAGER.INF

- MANAGER.HYP - the ST-Guide hypertext with online help for Manager



MANAGER.INF contains the default settings for the program. If this

file is missing, then the Manager will create one from the settings

you make in the program. When Manager is terminated, the .INF file

will be created provided the checkbox @{B}@{Save ignore} automatically@{b} is switched

on in the @{"Configuration dialog-box" LINK "Dialogbox Konfiguration"}.



If no databases are loaded, then at launch the Open command will be

performed.

@{U}1.2.1  Open [^O], [F2]                                 PHOENIX Manager@{u}



Activating this menu entry (or its equivalent in the function key bar

or the @{"second icon on the desktop" LINK "Schreibtisch des Managers"}), opens a new database, or one or

more items that have been selected by clicking on them and so are

displayed in inverse video. As an alternative, with a window open, a

double-click on an item using the left mouse button will open it.



If one or more data records in a @{"table window" LINK "Tabellen-Fenster"} are selected, then

this corresponds to using the Edit data command, although there are

exceptions from this for the special tables @{"query-list" LINK "Abfrageliste-Fenster"}, @{"template-list" LINK "Reportliste-Fenster"}

and @{"calculation-list" LINK "Rechnenliste-Fenster"}. If there are data records selected in one of

these, then they can be modified in their own special way (e.g. with

query by example).



If no item has been selected, then a new database can be opened. A

fileselector-box appears offering all files with the suffix .IND for

selection. After a file is chosen, the @{"Open database dialog-box" LINK "Dialogbox Datenbank îffnen"} will

appear, where you can set some parameters for the database.



@endnode

@toc "File menu"

@{U}1.2.2  Close [^U], [F3]                                PHOENIX Manager@{u}



The topped window of the program will be closed when this menu entry

(or its equivalent in the function key bar) is activated.



If there were any changes made to its data, then a safety query

appears offering the option of saving the data first.



If no window is open any more, then the command can no longer be used

and is therefore disabled.



@endnode





@node "Close DB"

@toc "File menu"

@{U}1.2.3  Close DB [^B], [F4]                             PHOENIX Manager@{u}



The current database will be closed immediately when this menu entry

(or its equivalent in the function key bar) is activated.



Before it is closed, all windows that belong to this database will be

closed. If there were any changes made to the data in one of its

windows, then a safety query appears offering the option of saving

the data first.



If a process is running on the database that is to be closed, then

this database can not be closed before the process is terminated by

force or normally.



If all databases are closed, then the command can no longer be used

and is therefore disabled.



@endnode





@node "Save"

@{U}1.2.4  Save [^S]                                       PHOENIX Manager@{u}



A defined query, a report, a calculation, a batch or a template will

be saved under its current name when this menu entry is activated.



If no name has been defined as yet, then the Save as command will be

called.



@endnode





@node "Save as"

@toc "File menu"

@{U}1.2.5  Save as [^M]                                    PHOENIX Manager@{u}



A defined query, a report, a calculation, a batch or a template can

be saved under a name of your choice.



When you select this menu entry, the dialog-box opens

that shows all items saved to date in a scrollable listbox, or lets

you enter a new name.



@endnode





@node "Export"

@toc "File menu"

@{U}1.2.6  Export [^E]                                     PHOENIX Manager@{u}



A table can be output as a binary file to a hard or floppy disk. The

command refers either to a selected table or selected data records, or

to the current table. If it is applied to a selected table or selected

data records, then only the fields that are curently displayed in the

table will be exported.



After activating this command a fileselector-box appears in which

you have to enter the desired filename.



The export of the table runs as a process in the background. You

can make certain settings for the table beforehand which affect the

appearance of the written data. These settings can be made in the

dialog-box that opens when you activate the @{"Im/Export parameters" LINK "Dialogbox Im/Export-Parameter"}

command.



@{I}Note:@{i}

Because the command can be applied to a selected table, it is

possible to export data from tables that are not otherwise

selectable. For instance, it is not possible to select the table

QUERY @{LIST ignore} in the @{"database toolbox" LINK "Schreibtisch des Managers" "Database toolbox"} because it is not displayed there

(we are dealing with an internal table). If, however, a query-list is

output (via the @{B}List@{b} command), then it can first be iconized,

subsequently selected and then exported.



@autorefoff

The QUERY LIST, REPORT LIST, CALCULATION LIST and BATCH LIST tables

@autorefon

are exported in a binary form by default, because usually they have

several line-dividers in the data record. If you want to export them

as ASCII files despite of this, you have to change the suffix BIN in

the fileselector-box to the suffix ASC.



@endnode

@xref "Export"

@{U}1.2.7  Import [^I]                                     PHOENIX Manager@{u}



A table can be read in as a text or binary file from a hard or floppy

disk. This command refers either to a selected table or selected data

records, or to the current table. If it is applied to a selected

table or selected data records, then only the fields that are

curently displayed in the table will be imported.



After activating this command a fileselector-box appears in which you

have to enter the desired filename.



The import of the table runs as a process in the background. You can

make certain settings for the table beforehand which affect the

appearance of the data. These settings can be made in the dialog-box

that opens when you activate the @{"Im/Export parameters" LINK "Dialogbox Im/Export-Parameter"} command.



@{I}Note:@{i}

Because the command can be applied to a selected table, it is possible

to export data from tables that are not otherwise selectable (see

Export).

@toc "File menu"

@{U}1.2.8  Disk output [^S]                                PHOENIX Manager@{u}



A table can be output as a text file to a hard or floppy disk. This

command refers either to a selected table or selected data records,

or to the current table.



After activating this command a fileselector-box appears in which you

have to enter the desired filename.



The output of the table runs as a process in the background. You

can make certain settings for the table beforehand which affect the

appearance of the table. These settings can be made in the dialog-box

that opens when you activate the @{"Page format" LINK "Dialogbox Seitenformat"} command.



@endnode





@node "Print"

@toc "File menu"

@{U}1.2.9  Print [^P]                                      PHOENIX Manager@{u}



A table can be output as a text file to a printer. This command

refers either to a selected table or selected data records, or to the

topped window or current table. However, the printing of the topped

window applies only to the @{"editor window" LINK "Editor-Fenster"}, the @{"report window" LINK "Bericht-Fenster"} and the

@{"template window" LINK "Report-Fenster"}.



The output of the table runs as a process in the background. You

can make certain settings for the table beforehand which affect the

appearance of the table. These settings can be made in the dialog-box

that opens when you activate the @{"Page format" LINK "Dialogbox Seitenformat"} command.



For printing, all the settings apply that can be defined with the

@{"Printer parameters" LINK "Dialogbox Drucker-Parameter"} command (except for a report, which uses NVDI for

producing hard copies).



@endnode





@node "Quit"

@toc "File menu"

@{U}1.2.10  Quit [^Q]                                      PHOENIX Manager@{u}



This command terminates the session. If there are still some unsaved

changes of data records, reports, queries, calculation definitions

etc., corresponding safety queries willl be displayed. This should

ensure that no data is lost accidentally. Results of queries, i.e.

@{"table-clipboards" LINK "table-clipboard window"}, are not saved.



When the Manager is quit, the file MANAGER.INF will be created or

updated provided @{B}@{Save ignore} automatically@{b} in the @{"Configuration dialog-box" LINK "Dialogbox Konfiguration"}

is switched on.

@toc "Edit menu"

@{U}1.3.1  Undo [^Z], [Undo]                               PHOENIX Manager@{u}



Activating this command reverses the last action you performed.

This can be achieved also by pressing the [Undo] key.



Whether the last action @{I}can@{i} be reversed depends on the topped window

and current circumstances. If the menu item is selectable (i.e. not

greyed out like this: @{G}Undo@{g}) then it can be applied.



In the description for @{"table windows" LINK "Tabellen-Fenster"} it is specified under which

circumstances the @{B}Undo@{b} command works when a table window is active.

The data record that was deleted last can be restored  with @{B}Undo@{b}.

The reinsertion of a deleted data record can also be rescinded, which

corresponds to a renewed deletion of the record.



@{I}Note:@{i}

The deletion and reinsertion of data records via the @{B}Undo@{b} command

always affects only the last data record, even if several data records

were deleted.



@endnode





@node "Cut"

@toc "Edit menu"

@{U}1.3.2  Cut [^X]                                        PHOENIX Manager@{u}



The selected items can be cut from the display by activating this

command. They will be copied to an internal buffer, so that they can

be inserted in another place.



However, this only applies to items that are in memory, so not for

data records, for instance.



@endnode





@node "Copy"

@toc "Edit menu"

@{U}1.3.3  Copy [^C]                                       PHOENIX Manager@{u}



This command works like the Cut command, but the original item will

remain in place. If data records are selected in a @{"table window" LINK "Tabellen-Fenster"},

then these can not be copied.



@endnode





@node "Paste"

@toc "Edit menu"

@{U}1.3.4  Paste [^V]                                      PHOENIX Manager@{u}



Activating this command inserts the last item @{"cut" LINK "Cut"} or @{"copied" LINK "Copy"}.

Depending on the window and  context, this can produce different

effects. If a data record was cut from a @{"table window" LINK "Tabellen-Fenster"}, then it can

be reinserted with this, of course.



In addition, all data records that were deleted previously can be put

back again; this can be done either individually by selecting them in

the @{"wastebin window" LINK "Papierkorb-Fenster"}, or all of them by selecting the @{"wastebin icon" LINK "Papierkorb-Sinnbild"}

and then activating this command.



@{I}Note:@{i}

If a database is reorganised, it will forget all previously deleted

data records, so that these can no longer be restored.



@endnode





@node "Delete"

@toc "Edit menu"

@{U}1.3.5  Delete [^D]                                     PHOENIX Manager@{u}



The selected items will be deleted without copying them into a buffer

when you activate this command. If data records in a table are

selected, then they can be restored via the @{"wastebin window" LINK "Papierkorb-Fenster"}.



@endnode





@node "Select all"

@toc "Edit menu"

@{U}1.3.6  Select all [^A]                                 PHOENIX Manager@{u}



On activating this menu entry all items of the current window will be

selected, provided that they are selectable.



In a @{"table window" LINK "Tabellen-Fenster"}, all data records visible in the window will be

selected. If no window is open, then all items that are present on

@{"the Manager's desktop" LINK "Schreibtisch des Managers"} will be selected.



So, say, if all @{"table icons" LINK "Tabellen-Sinnbild"} and all @{"table-clipboard icons" LINK "Tabellenklemmbrett-Sinnbild"} are to be

removed from the desktop, then you must use the @{B}Select all@{b} command

followed by the @{B}Remove@{b} command. A prerequisite for this is that no

other window is open at the time. In addition all processes that may

be running will be removed, unless they were deselected again.



@endnode





@node "Search"

@toc "Edit menu"

@{U}1.3.7  Search [^F]                                     PHOENIX Manager@{u}



Activating this command opens the @{"Search dialog-box" LINK "Dialogbox Suchen"}. This makes it

possible to search for a certain term in a @{"table window" LINK "Tabellen-Fenster"} either via

an index or in the complete text.



@endnode





@node "Search again"

@toc "Edit menu"

@{U}1.3.8  Search again [^G]                               PHOENIX Manager@{u}



This command searches for the next term from the @{"Search dialog-box" LINK "Dialogbox Suchen"}.

@{U}1.3.9  Iconize [F5]                                    PHOENIX Manager@{u}



When you activate this menu entry (or its equivalent in the function

key bar) the topped window will be converted to an icon. You can

perform some operations with the icon (see Icon operations in the

@{"The Manager's desktop" LINK "Schreibtisch des Managers"} description).



If the topped window is a @{"table window" LINK "Tabellen-Fenster"} or a @{"process window" LINK "Prozeû-Fenster"}, then this

command can be performed also by clicking with the left mouse-button

on the window's Closer button while holding down the [Alternate] key

(without pressing this key the window would just be closed).



@endnode





@node "Cycle windows"

@toc "Edit menu"

@{U}1.3.10  Cycle windows [^W]                             PHOENIX Manager@{u}



This command allows the user to switch between the opened windows of

the active program. This always places the lower-most window right

at the top.



@{I}Tip:@{i}

Alternatively, [Alternate]+[Esc], [Control]+[Esc] or [Control]+[W]

key presses are allowed and produce the same result!



@endnode





@node "Open table"

@toc "Edit menu"

@{U}1.3.11  Open table [^T]                                PHOENIX Manager@{u}



A new @{"table window" LINK "Tabellen-Fenster"} will be opened when you activate this command. It

displays the data records with the values set at the time of opening

the @{"database toolbox" LINK "Schreibtisch des Managers" "Database toolbox"}:

- The current database

- The current table

- The current index

- The current sorting direction

- The currently set font



The font can be set by using the Font command in the Parameters menu.

The handling of this window is described in the @{"table window" LINK "Tabellen-Fenster"} section.

@toc "Edit menu"

@{U}1.3.12  Edit data [F10]                                PHOENIX Manager@{u}



This menu entry (or its equivalent in the function key bar and also

the mask icon in the @{"desktop" LINK "Schreibtisch des Managers"} and @{"table window" LINK "Tabellen-Fenster"} menu bars) offers a

number of functions:



If data records of a table window are selected, then they can be

modified. If @{"table icons" LINK "Tabellen-Sinnbild"} or @{"table-clipboard icons" LINK "Tabellenklemmbrett-Sinnbild"} are selected, then

the data records of these icons can be edited.



If no items are selected, then the data records of the current table

in the current database can be modified.



When editing data records, masks for this table defined in @{Designer ignore}

will open. In a @{"mask window" LINK "Masken-Fenster"} you can modify the data records, i.e.

change or delete them, or input new items.



@endnode





@node "Remove"

@toc "Edit menu"

@{U}1.3.13  Remove [^R]                                    PHOENIX Manager@{u}



This command can be activated when @{"table icons" LINK "Tabellen-Sinnbild"} or data records in a

table-clipboard window have been selected.

You can use this command also when a @{"process icon" LINK "Prozeû-Sinnbild"} is selected.



If any data records are selected, then they will be removed from the

table-clipboard without being physically deleted. If table icons have

been selected then these too are removed from the desktop without

deletion.



If process icons are selected then these processes will be terminated.

A safety query appears before the termination.



@endnode

@toc "Edit menu"

@{U}1.3.14  Remove range [^L]                              PHOENIX Manager@{u}



This command opens the @{"Remove range dialog-box" LINK "Dialogbox Bereich entfernen"}.



This makes it possible to remove a given range of data records from a

table-clipboard window. It can only be applied when such a window is

topped and contains at least one record.

@toc "Edit menu"

@{U}1.3.15  Empty wastebin [^H]                            PHOENIX Manager@{u}



On activating this menu entry the wastebin will be cleared. Following

this it is no longer possible to access deleted data records. The

emptying of the wastebin runs as a process in the background and can

be interrupted at any time (see description of @{"process window" LINK "Prozeû-Fenster"}).



Before the actual clearance a safety query appears, which you have to

confirm for the action to go ahead.

@toc "Process menu"

@{U}1.4.3  Execute [X]                                    PHOENIX Manager@{u}



With this command a query, a report, a calculation, a batch or a

template can be executed.



@{U}Query@{u}

If a data record in a @{"query-list window" LINK "Abfrageliste-Fenster"} is selected, then the data

records appropriate to this query will be searched for.



If a @{"query window" LINK "Abfrage-Fenster"} is topped, then the corresponding query will be

executed. The search of the data records runs as a background process,

so that you can continue to work during the search. If sorting is

required, then the data records will be sorted after the search.

Sorting does not run in the background. During this sorting process

a dialog-box provides information about its progress. After the data

records have been searched and sorted, if appropriate, a @{"table window" LINK "Tabellen-Fenster"}

opens automatically which displays the found data records.



A query can be executed only if it does not contain any errors. If

errors occur, this will be reported in an error alert, so giving you

the opportunity to make corrections. The statements in the error alert

refer to the generated SQL command.



@{I}Note:@{i}

The search of data records can proceed quickly or slowly. That depends

on the type of query. The program attempts to obtain the result as

quickly as possible. This succeeds particularly when a query is set

with the equality condition or the BETWEEN condition in an already

existing index.



The time shown in the @{"process window" LINK "Prozeû-Fenster"} is the maximum time for the

search.



@{U}Template@{u}

If a @{"template window" LINK "Report-Fenster"} is topped then this template will be executed.



If a @{"table icon" LINK "Tabellen-Sinnbild"} or data records in a table are selected, then the

Manager attempts to combine these data records with the template,

i.e. to execute the template on these data records. If no items are

selected, then the table specified under {$TABELLE=..} will be used as

the source of data.



A template can be executed only if it does not contain any errors. If

errors occur, this will be reported in an error alert, so giving you

the opportunity to make corrections. The execution of the template

runs as a background process. Before execution of the template you

have to select whether the template is to be output to the @{B}Screen@{b},

the @{B}Printer@{b}, or into a @{B}File@{b}.



@{I}Note:@{i}

If the template is present in the 1st Word Plus format, then it has

to be output to a file, since the Manager can not print the Wordplus

format directly. Nevertheless, the output file of the template retains

the Wordplus attributes (bold, underscored etc.) as well as any incor-

porated graphics. This file can then be printed in the 1st Word Plus

program.



@{U}Calculation@{u}

The calculation is executed as a background process. The data record

set to which a calculation is applied can be defined in various ways:



  1. If no item is selected on the desktop or in a @{"table window" LINK "Tabellen-Fenster"}, then

     the calculation will be performed on all data records of the

     current table of the @{"database toolbox" LINK "Schreibtisch des Managers" "Database toolbox"}.

  2. If a @{"table icon" LINK "Tabellen-Sinnbild"} or a @{"table-clipboard icon" LINK "Tabellenklemmbrett-Sinnbild"} is selected on the

     desktop, then the calculation will be performed on all data

     records of the source of this icon.

  3. If data records in a table window are selected, then the calcula-

     tion will be performed on all selected data records.



For executing a calculation you can also drag a table from the

@{"database toolbox" LINK "Schreibtisch des Managers" "Database toolbox"}, a table icon, or data records from a @{"table window" LINK "Tabellen-Fenster"}

onto the @{"calculation window" LINK "Rechnen-Fenster"}.



@{U}Batch@{u}

If a data record in a @{"batch-list window" LINK "Batchliste-Fenster"} is selected, then the batch

will be executed. If a @{"batch window" LINK "Batch-Fenster"} is topped, then this batch will

be executed.



The processing of a batch runs as a background process, so that you

can continue working during the batch run. Running the batch can nudge

other processes into action. If there are 6 processes running already,

then the batch run will be blocked if it tries to start yet another

process until a process is available to be started again.

@toc "Options menu"

@{U}1.7.2  Reorganisation [^F3]                            PHOENIX Manager@{u}



This menu entry serves to call the reorganisation module.



The Reorganiser must be called each time new indices are defined

in the @{Designer ignore} when data records have been entered already in the

associated table. This is because then a new index tree has to be

created for them. In such cases an alert message appears.



Additionally the Reorganiser should be called whenever the database

was not closed correctly. This is made known by an alert message when

opening the affected database. This happens for instance in the case

of a power failure, or if the computer crashed or was switched off

before any alterations to the database were saved.



If a database is open when this call is made then the database will

be reorganised. Otherwise the fileselector opens in which a database

has to be selected. In both cases the @{"Reorganise database dialog-box" LINK "Dialogbox Datenbank reorganisieren"}

will appear, in which you may have to enter your name and password to

check that you have the correct access rights to permit this action.

Provided all is well the @{"Reorganisation parameters dialog-box" LINK "Dialogbox Reorganisations-Parameter"} appears.



The reorganisation does not run as a background process.



It is split into five phases:



  1. Creation of a temporary database

  2. Reading the first five data records of the data dictionary

  3. Reading of the whole data dictionary

  4. Writing the data dictionary into the temporary database

  5. Reading and writing the remaining data records



After the reorganisation some statistics about the effect of the

action will be output.



Using the Reorganisation function is also recommended when frequent

alterations have been made to the database (many deletions and

changes). In such cases 'holes' appear in the database in which you

can no longer store any data records. Furthermore all deleted data

records will be stored for the time being. This memory space too will

not be available for new data records. The size of the holes can be

established by invoking the @{"Database info" LINK "Dialogbox Datenbank-Info"} command in the Help menu.



@{I}Note:@{i}

The larger a cache you choose the faster the reorganiser runs.



@{I}Warning!@{i}

After calling the Reorganiser any deleted data records will be lost,

since during reorganisation the wastebin will be cleared.

@{U}2.1.1  Save (record) [S]                              PHOENIX Manager@{u}



On activating this @{"mask window" LINK "Masken-Fenster"} menu entry, or its icon bar equivalent,

the current data record will be saved.



PHOENIX offers two options for saving a data record:



  1. If a new data record was created, then it will be inserted into

     the table. A new data record can be input by pressing the @{B}@{New ignore}@{b}

     icon (the tabbed index card) or use the command New mask in the

     Actions menu. A new data record can be recognised by the greyed

@autorefoff

     out appearance of the Delete icon (the wastebasket) and @{B}Delete@{b}

@autorefon

     menu entry). In that case the saving performs the same as the

     @{"Insert" LINK "Insert (record)"} command. After this the contents of the mask will be

     cleared, so that you can compose a new data record; this can be

     switched off in the @{"Configure masks" LINK "Dialogbox Masken-Konfiguration"} command of the Manager's

     Parameters menu.

## Hier stand:

##                                         'Das Lîschen des Inhaltes

##     kînnen Sie Åber den Befehl Konfiguration im MenÅ Optionen des

##     Maskenfensters einstellen.'

## ABER ich finde diesen Befehl nicht dort. Ich glaube das obere stimmt.





  2. An existing data record that was modified in the mask will be

     written back to the database at it appears in the mask. In that

     case the command Change will be performed.



@autorefoff

Normally you will use the @{B}Save@{b} command, as PHOENIX automatically finds

@autorefon

the correct save operation for you (Insert = INSERT in the first case,

Change = UPDATE in the second case).



@{I}Warning!@{i}

Before saving the data record any active calculation (see the command

Allocate calculation) or any @{"Exit calculation" LINK "DESIGNER.HYP/Dialogbox Masken-Info"} that may have been

programmed will be performed.

@node "Insert (record)"

@toc "Record menu"

@{U}2.1.2  Insert (record) [I]                            PHOENIX Manager@{u}



On activating this @{"mask window" LINK "Masken-Fenster"} menu entry, or its icon bar equivalent,

the data record in the mask will be inserted into the table.



After the insertion the contents of the mask will be cleared, so that

you can compose a new data record; this can be switched off in the

@{"Configure masks" LINK "Dialogbox Masken-Konfiguration"} command of Manager's Parameters menu.

## WAR wieder faelschlich:

@{I}Warning!@{i}

Before insertion of the data record any active calculation (see the

Allocate calculation command) or any @{"Exit calculation" LINK "DESIGNER.HYP/Dialogbox Masken-Info"} that may have

been programmed will be performed.



@endnode





@node "Change"

@{U}2.1.3  Change [U]                                     PHOENIX Manager@{u}



On activating this @{"mask window" LINK "Masken-Fenster"} menu entry, or its icon bar equivalent,

the data record displayed in the mask will be updated and saved in

the associated table.



The command can be performed only when you are @{I}not@{i} dealing with a

newly input data record that was created with the New mask command.

If you are handling an already acquired data record then @{B}Change@{b}

corresponds to the command Save (record).



@{I}Warning!@{i}

Before changing the data record any active calculation (see the

Allocate calculation command) or any @{"Exit calculation" LINK "DESIGNER.HYP/Dialogbox Masken-Info"} that may have

been programmed will be performed.

@node "Search (record)"

@toc "Record menu"

@{U}2.1.4  Search (record) [F]                            PHOENIX Manager@{u}



On activating this @{"mask window" LINK "Masken-Fenster"} menu entry, or its icon bar equivalent,

then if the cursor is over a field that was defined as an index, the

Manager will switch to this field and attempt to find the data record.

If the data record is not found then an error message will be output

and the data record that comes closest to the search term will be

displayed.



It's best to clear the mask beforehand with the New mask command and

enter the search term into the desired field.



You may use the following wildcards:



* represents any character-string (may be empty as well)

? represents just one character of any kind



If the cursor is not over an index field, then Manager switches over

to a "Sequentiell" index and attempts to find the data record sequen-

tially. A largish data cache is particularly favourable here, as each

data record will be read in and searched in turn.



If you want to search in a multi-index, the use the Multi-search

command.



@endnode





@node "Multi-search"

@toc "Record menu"

@{U}2.1.5  Multi-search [M]                               PHOENIX Manager@{u}



Activating this @{"mask window" LINK "Masken-Fenster"} menu entry permits multi-index searches.

If the current index is a multi-index, then you can search in this

index by inputting the search arguments into the individual components

of the multi-index.



It's best to clear the mask beforehand with the New mask command and

enter the search term into the desired fields.



You may use the following wildcards:



* represents any character-string (may be empty as well)

? represents just one character of any kind



@{I}Tip:@{i}

Instead of using this command you can also click with the mouse on

the 'binoculars' icon while holding down the [Alternate] key.

@{U}2.1.6  Delete (record) [D]                            PHOENIX Manager@{u}



The data record in the mask will be deleted when you activate this

@{"mask window" LINK "Masken-Fenster"} menu entry, or its icon bar equivalent.



Data records can be deleted only if they are not new data records

that were created with the New mask command.

This command is selectable if a calculation was assigned to a table

(see also the Allocate calculation command).



On activating this @{"mask window" LINK "Masken-Fenster"} menu entry, or its icon bar equivalent,

the calculation will be performed and the mask updated.

On activating this @{"mask window" LINK "Masken-Fenster"} menu entry, or its icon bar equivalent,

all fields of a mask will be cleared so that you can compose a new

data record.



Once you have filled in a new record, it can be saved in the table

with the mask window's @{"Insert" LINK "Insert (record)"} or @{"Save" LINK "Save (record)"} commands.

On activating this @{"mask window" LINK "Masken-Fenster"} menu entry, or its icon bar equivalent,

the mask displays one data record back in the set sorting order.

For the first data record the command is greyed out.



If the sorting order is @{B}Descending@{b}, the position will also be one

record back in the displayed order, which is actually the next higher

On activating this @{"mask window" LINK "Masken-Fenster"} menu entry, or its icon bar equivalent,

the mask displays one data record forwards in the set sorting order.

For the last data record the command is greyed out.



If the sorting order is @{B}Descending@{b}, the position will also be one

@{U}2.3.1  Import field [^I]                               PHOENIX Manager@{u}



Data from external files can be read into a field by activating this

@{"mask window" LINK "Masken-Fenster"} menu entry. Depending on the data type of the field only

certain kinds of data can be imported.



The following table shows the @{"data type" LINK "DESIGNER.HYP/Data types"} and the kind of external file

that can be used:



@{I}Data type      Kind of file @{i}

@Line 1 39 0 0 1

Graphic        GEM and IMG files

BLOB           SAM and any other files

All others     Any ASCII file



So to get graphics into a field, for instance, you have to import the

data from outside into the field. A fileselector-box appears in which

you can choose the desired file.



@{I}Warning!@{i}

Apart from GEM and IMG files, do not import any files with unknown

graphics types into a graphical field, as this could lead to some

unexpected results!



@endnode

@toc "Options menu (for mask windows)"

@{U}2.3.2  Export field [^E]                               PHOENIX Manager@{u}



Data from a field can be exported to external files by activating this

@{"mask window" LINK "Masken-Fenster"} menu entry. The data in the field determines the suffix

(extension) that will be suggested in the fileselector's input line.



The following table shows the @{"data type" LINK "DESIGNER.HYP/Data types"} and the kind of external file

that can be used:



@{I}Data type      Suffix of file @{i}

@Line 1 57 0 0 1

Graphic        .GEM or .IMG (depending on field contents)

BLOB           .SAM or .* (dependiong on field conteents)

All others     .*



So to get graphics out of a field, for instance, you have to export

the field. A fileselector-box appears in which you have to input the

external file's name. This allows you to modify graphics outside of

PHOENIX with a graphics program and later reimport them.

@node "Display field"

@toc "Options menu (for mask windows)"

@{U}2.3.3  Display field [^O]                              PHOENIX Manager@{u}



On activating this @{"mask window" LINK "Masken-Fenster"} menu entry, an attempt is made to

interpret the contents of a field and to display it. The command can

be selected only when the field is of the data type @{"External file" LINK "DESIGNER.HYP/Data types" 40}

or @{"BLOB" LINK "DESIGNER.HYP/Data types" 72}. With the latter only sound data that had the suffix .SAM

during import can be reproduced. Other interpretations are not yet

available in this version.



A field of the External file data type will contain a filename.

Depending on the suffix an attempt will be made to display the file

in a new window.



The proceedings will be as follows:



@{I}Suffix     Window with @{i}

@Line 1 33 0 0 1

GEM        GEM vector graphic

IMG        GEM bit-image graphic

SAM        Sampled sound data

Any other  ASCII files



If you use external files that contain neither GEM vector graphics,

GEM bit-image files, sound data nor pure ASCII files then this could

lead to unforeseen results.

@{U}2.3.4  Get filename [^V]                               PHOENIX Manager@{u}



On activating this @{"mask window" LINK "Masken-Fenster"} menu entry, a fileselector-box appears

in which you can select any file you choose. The complete name of the

file (with access path) will be taken over by the field and adapted

to the existing text.



This is particularly useful for fields of the @{"External file" LINK "DESIGNER.HYP/Data types" 40} data

type since then you do not have to input filenames manually.

On activating this @{"mask window" LINK "Masken-Fenster"} menu entry (or the '~>' icon in the

@{"template window" LINK "Report-Fenster"}), you can branch to another (or the same) table via

an index. The @{"Branch dialog-box" LINK "Dialogbox Verzweigen"} opens.

@{U}2.3.7  Show popup [^N]                                 PHOENIX Manager@{u}



On activating this @{"mask window" LINK "Masken-Fenster"} menu entry, a popup listbox appears in

the current field under the cursor. Instead of using this command you

can also click with the mouse on the down arrow next to the field, if

there is one.



The values (or items) that appear in the listbox depend on several

factors:



If a value table relationship was defined in @{Designer ignore} for the current

field (see @{"Designer: Value tables" LINK "DESIGNER.HYP/Value tables"}) then all data records of this

value table will be displayed. It will appear sorted if an index was

defined in the value table for the field. Otherwise the values (items)

will appear sequentially.



If no value table was defined, then the listbox displays all values of

the field that are present in the current table. This makes it easy to

check whether a given item exists already, or you can just pick out

one value from the items that are present.



Pressing the [Esc] key, or clicking outside the listbox, retains the

old value in the field and closes the popup.

@toc "The windows"

@{U}3.1  Batch window                                      PHOENIX Manager@{u}



A batch is a series of commands which can be implemented in the back-

ground (see also Execute).



A batch window can be created by using the NewBatch command in the

Process menu (or its equivalent in the function key bar), as well as

by the Open command as long as a data record in a @{"batch-list window" LINK "Batchliste-Fenster"}

has been selected.



The title line shows the name of the database being used.



The info line shows the current name of the batch. Hence it will be

empty when dealing with a new batch.



Below the info line there are two popup listboxes. These offer the

@{B}Commands@{b} the batch manager understands and the available @{B}Parameters@{b}

for the current command.



The rest of the window serves for defining the batches. This can be

treated as a simple text editor, in which the batch can be entered.



Each command starts on a new line. If a line starts with a ';', then

this line will be regarded as a comment.



The commands and their parameters can be entered in capitals or lower

case - it makes no difference. Alternatively, clicking on any of the

listbox entries will insert the command or parameter at the current

cursor position.



The following commands are defined:



@{I}Command     Meaning @{i}

If a query is specified (with the parameter QUERY), then the parame-

ters TABLE, INDEX and DIR lose their meaning, and will be ignored.



The parameters are always specified by the syntax PARAMETER=VALUE,

where the word PARAMETER is replaced by the corresponding parameter

and VALUE by the desired value.



The following syntax applies for the parameters:

Here the character '|' means OR, and one of its listed options @{I}has@{i}

to be used.



The parameter values have the following meaning:



@{I}Param. value   Meaning @{i}

@Line 1 61 0 0 1

<Name>         Identifier of a table or an index.

<Number>       A positive number or the number of a table or

               of an index. The numbering starts with 0.

<Queryname>    Name of a query.

<Filename>     Name of an external file.

<Objectname>   Name of an object, which can be a calculation,

               a template, a batch, a query or a mask.

ASC            Ascending

DESC           Descending

TRUE           True (switched on)

FALSE          False (switched off)

SCREEN         Monitor screen

@{DISK ignore}           Hard or floppy disk

PRINTER        Printer



If parameters are omitted then default values will be substituted.

For filenames you will be asked first for the file, with devices for

the screen, file or printer.



 <EXCLUSIVE>  means that a process is run exclusively.



 @{<MINIMIZE ignore}>   means that a process or a @{"table window" LINK "Tabellen-Fenster"} is stored

              immediately after creation as an icon.



 <DEVICE>     means the output device for the template.



 <FONTSIZE>   means the height of the font for a table window

              (see @{"Font dialog-box" LINK "Dialogbox Schriftart"}).



 <SIZE>       is the size of a table window. The four values specify

              the X- and Y-coordinates as well as width and height of

              the window. The first two values are multiplied by the

              width or height respectively of the system font, the

              two latter ones give the size in characters and lines.

              The actual size is dependent of the selected font.



The four values that can be set with the SET command are variables

that are initialised at the start of a batch-run:



 TABLE:     First table

 INDEX:     First index

 DIR:       ASC

 FONTSIZE:  System font



These variables are independent of the settings made by the user in

the @{"database toolbox" LINK "Schreibtisch des Managers" "Database toolbox"}. The values will be used whenever a command has

not included specifications of table, index, direction or font size.

The batch function CALCULATE executes a calculation. It has the same

effect as the Process/Execute menu entry with an opened calculation

window. This calculation must have been defined previously and saved

in the calculation-list (see @{"calculation window" LINK "Rechnen-Fenster"}).

As parameters one has to pass at least the name of the calculation

DELETE <TABLE> <QUERY> <INDEX> <DIR> @{<MINIMIZE ignore}> <EXCLUSIVE>



The batch command DELETE is used for deleting data records. It serves

the same purpose as the Edit/Delete main menu entry, or the dragging

of data records and @{"table icons" LINK "Tabellen-Sinnbild"} to the wastebin.



The data records to be deleted are specified via the parameters. So

if you specify the parameter TABLE= , the whole table will be deleted

(so be careful!) With the parameter QUERY one can specify the name of

a query that selects the data records to be deleted.

DISK <TABLE> <QUERY> <INDEX> <DIR> @{<MINIMIZE ignore}> <FILE> <LAY> <EXCLUSIVE>



This batch command is used for outputting table lists to a file.

It is comparable to the File/Disk output entry of the main menu.



As parameters you have to pass at least the name of the table to be

exported (TABLE=) or a query for selecting the data (QUERY=) and the

name of the output file (FILE=). Should the output be in a given

format (page length, headers/footers...), then the output format can

be set via the Parameters/@{"Page format dialog-box" LINK "Dialogbox Seitenformat"} and saved in the

parameters file with the suffix .LAY. During execution of the batch

command this file can be specified via the parameter LAY= and then

loaded.

EDIT <TABLE> <QUERY> <INDEX> <DIR> <NAME> <SIZE>



The batch command EDIT brins the input mask of the table specified by

TABLE= to the screen. If only a selection of data records in the input

mask are to be modified, then these can be selected by a query

specified by QUERY=. If the parameter INDEX= is used to specify an

index field, then the data records will displayed in the input mask

sorted according to this index, and one can search and browse in the

mask. If several masks were defined for a table and a different mask

to the standard one is to be displayed, then specify the name of this

mask in the parameter field NAME=.



@{I}Example:@{i}

EDIT TABLE=CLIENTS INDEX=ClientNo DIR=DESC NAME="MaskTwo"



(Meaning: For the table @{B}CLIENTS@{b} the input mask with the name @{B}MaskTwo@{b}

With the batch command @{EXPORT ignore} one can export data records. It is

comparable to the File/Export entry of the main menu. You can export

a complete table (by specifying the parameter TABLE=), or just a

selection of data records that are determined by a query in the

QUERY= parameter. The name of the export file is set by the parameter

field FILE=. After IMP= you can specify a parameter file with export

parameters.

Creates a @{"table window" LINK "Tabellen-Fenster"} on the screen and so has the same effect as a

double-click on a table or index name in the @{"database toolbox" LINK "Schreibtisch des Managers" "Database toolbox"}. The

relevant table can be determined via the parameter TABLE=. Should a

query be performed, then just give the name of the query with the

@{U}3.3  Calculation window                                PHOENIX Manager@{u}

@autorefon



A calculation window can be created by using the New@{Calculation ignore}

command in the Process menu (or its equivalent in the function key

bar), or by using the Open command provided that a data record in a

calculation-list is selected during this.



The window serves for the definition of a calculation and is built up

in a similar way to a @{"template window" LINK "Report-Fenster"}. The title line of the window

shows the table for which the calculation is to be created.



When the New@{Calculation ignore} command in the Process menu is activated,

the table currently selected in the @{"database toolbox" LINK "Schreibtisch des Managers" "Database toolbox"} will be used.



## Addiert/Erweitert

You can also open a calculation window for an existing entry in a

@{"calculation-list window" LINK "Rechnenliste-Fenster"} by double-clicking on an entry or using the

Open command while an item in this list is selected; this too will

show the currently selected table from the database toolbox in the

@{B}Table@{b} listbox, and it is up to you to select the correct name from

the drop-down list. If the calculation was saved previously, the

info line above will contain the name of the calculation.



In the area below this are four popup listboxes. They contain all the

tables, fields and indices as well as all the operators and reserved

designators that may be used in a calculation. The contents of the

@{B}Field@{b} and @{B}Index@{b} listboxes will change if another @{B}Table@{b} is selected.

## Erweitert



@{U}The listbox may be operated from the keyboard:@{u}

- [Shift]+[F3] drops down the @{B}Table@{b} listbox

- [Shift]+[F4] drops down the @{B}Field@{b} listbox

- [Shift]+[F5] drops down the @{B}Index@{b} listbox

- [Shift]+[F6] drops down the @{B}Op@{b}erators listbox

You can then use the up/down arrow keys to select one of the items

in the list.



## Erweitert

The lower part of the window is the area where you can define your

calculation. You can either type in the definition, or use the items

in the @{B}Field@{b}, @{B}Index@{b} and @{B}Op@{b}erator listboxes: Pressing [Return] or

[Enter] inserts the item selected in the listbox at the cursor

position.



To use several calculation commands in a definition, separate the

individual assignments with a semicolon (;).



@{I}Example:@{i}

Buy_date = SYSDATE;

Total_cost = Number * Unit_price;



If one of the commands Execute, Allocate calculation, Save or Save as

is performed then the calculation will be checked, and if it is not

in order you will be informed of the error and its position by an

alert box.



To save your calculation definition under a name of your choice, use

the Save as menu command to open the @{"Save calculation as dialog-box" LINK "Dialogbox Rechnen sichern als"}.

Only correct definitions can be saved.

@{I}Tip:@{i}

The LAST designator provides an excellent way of automating the

progressive numbering of client numbers, for instance.



With the calculation:



Clientnumber = LAST (Clientnumber) + 1;



you will always get the first free client number that has not been

used yet, even if some client numbers have been deleted meanwhile.



@{U}Data types@{u}

Every field has a given data type (Text, Number, Long, Date etc.).

For more details, see @{"Data types" LINK "DESIGNER.HYP/Data types"} in the @{Designer ignore} Help pages.



Depending on the data type, not every assignment and combination of

fields is permitted. Thus, for instance, you can not add a Time field

to a Floating-point field. Furthermore, the designator SYSDATE can

be used only in connection with Date fields, the designator SYSTIME

only in connection with Time fields and the designator SYSTIMESTAMP

only in connection with fields of the TIMESTAMP type.

All numbers (Number, Long, Floating-point) that appear in a calcuation

are first converted internally to floating-point numbers and only then

will the calculation be performed.

During the assignment to a field it will then be converted back to a

suitable type.



@{U}Text fields and fields of the External file type@{u}

With Text and @{"External file" LINK "DESIGNER.HYP/Data types" 40} fields, only the '+' operator may be used.

An addition of two texts means a concatenation of both character-

strings:

PLZ_Town = PLZ + " " + Town gives the value '69126 Heidelberg' if the

field 'PLZ' contains the mumber 69126 and the field 'Town' the value

Heidelberg.



To replace a character-string by another one you can use the REPLACE

command.



@{I}Examples:@{i}

a)

Name = REPLACE (Name, "Ñ", "ae");



replaces every 'Ñ' by 'ae' in the field 'Name'.



b)

NameWithDots = REPLACE (Forename : 20, ' ', '.');



fills up the forename to 20 places with dots.



c)

Name = SUBSTR (Text, 3, 4);



assigns to the field 'Name' from the third character of Text onwards

four further characters.



d)

VAR i;

i = 1;

WHILE (i <= 10) DO

FIELD ("Name" + i) = ";



sets all fields 'Name1' etc. to 'Name10' to empty.



@{U}Date, Time and Timestamp fields@{u}

For fields of this type you can apply only addition or subtraction.

The fields 'Guaranteed_to' and 'Purchased' are of the type Date.



The calculation



Guaranteed_to = Purchased;

MONTH (Guaranteed_to) = MONTH (Guaranteed_to) + 6;



adds 6 months to the field 'Guaranteed_to'. Before this the field

'Guaranteed_to' has to be filled with the value of the field

'Purchased'!



The subtraction of two Date fields returns the number of days between

the two dates. Leap years are taken into account. Thus



Used = SYSDATE - Purchased;



gives the number of days elapsed since the purchase date. The field

'Used' here is of the type Number, Long or Floating-point.



To a Time field one can only sensibly add another time value. The

subtraction of two time values returns a time interval in the format

HHMMSSmmmmmm (the 'm' represents microseconds).



Time constants can be added to or subtracted from Time fields as

follows: 'End_max' and 'Start_time' are two fields of the type TIME:



End_max = Start_time + TIME (00:13:45);



The field 'End_max' is assigned the value 'Start_time' increased by

13 minutes and 45 seconds.



To a field of the type TIMESTAMP you can add Date and Time fields.

The subtraction of two TIMESTAMP values returns a duration in the

format



DDMMYYYYHHMMSSmmmmmm (Day,Month,Year,Hour,Minute,Second,Microsecond).



@{I}Examples:@{i}

Seconds = SECOND (Time) + MINUTE (Time) * 60 + HOUR (Time) * 3600;



calculates the number of seconds from the field 'Time' and assigns

these to the field 'Seconds'.



Days = SYSDATE - DATE (17.3.1991);



calculates the days between the current date and the constant

date 17.3.1991. The constant date must be specified in the default

format. This can be changed in @{Designer ignore} (see the @{"Format command" LINK "DESIGNER.HYP/Dialogbox Format"} in

@{Designer ignore}).

@toc "The windows"

@autorefoff

@{U}3.4  Calculation-list window [F8]                     PHOENIX Manager@{u}

@autorefon



This window is a normal @{"table window" LINK "Tabellen-Fenster"}. It displays the table names for

which a calculation was defined, and the names of the calculations.

The third column of the table contains the text of the calculation.



In contrast to a normal table, this window has additional properties.

If a data record in this window is selected then the following actions

can be performed:

- Left double-click: Call of the Open command

- Right double-click: Call of the Execute command

- @{B}Allocate calculation@{b} command: Assigns the calculation to the current

  table



When executing the Open command, instead of opening a mask window as

with normal table windows, a @{"calculation window" LINK "Rechnen-Fenster"} will be opened. This

displays the previously selected data record. In it, previously saved

calculations can be modified. How a valculation window is used is

described in the @{"Calculation window" LINK "Rechnen-Fenster"} section.



If you want to modify a calculation definition via a normal mask

window, then after selecting an entry, the Edit data command of the

Edit menu can be activated, which makes a mask appear.



## Erweitert

This will be the mask SYSTEM.Rechnungen (= SYSTEM.Calculations). In

this calculation-list window you can input a calculation directly in

the large @{B}Text@{b} field; the contents scroll when you reach the right

border. The @{B}Name@{b} field can be edited freely, so that you can alter

the name of the calculation subsequently.

For executing the calculation, however, it has to be saved first (with

the @{Save ignore} button [DB] in the icon bar or the @{B}Record/@{Save ignore}@{b} menu entry of

the mask window), then selected in the calculation-list and the Execute

command called. The @{B}Code@{b} and @{B}Flags@{b} fields are only used internally

and should not be altered.



The only advantage of this type of definition is that a Text field can

be imported and exported in a mask window. This makes it possible to

adopt a calculation from an external text editor by placing the cursor

in the @{B}Text@{b} field and using the Import field command.

@{U}3.6  Editor window                                     PHOENIX Manager@{u}



An editor window is opened when texts are to be displayed on-screen.

It can be activated by double-clicking the Drive icon on the desktop.

A fileselector-box opens in which you have to select the file

containing the text. If there is none, create an empty file CACHE.IDX

in your TMP directory and use that.



In the editor window you can modify the text. The cursor can be posi-

tioned with the mouse. Marking (highlighting) is not yet possible in

this version, however. A line can be deleted by pressing both the

[Control] and [@{Delete ignore}] keys together. For keyboard control, the same

applies as for a text object in the @{"mask window" LINK "Masken-Fenster" 121}.



@endnode





@node "Masken-Fenster" "Mask window"

@toc "The windows"

@xref "Change mask"

@{U}3.7  Mask window                                       PHOENIX Manager@{u}



A mask window is created with the Edit data command of the Edit menu

(or its equivalent in the function key bar on the desktop).



If there is no item selected, a mask for the current table from the

@{"database toolbox" LINK "Schreibtisch des Managers" "Database toolbox"} appears. Otherwise a mask for the table to which

the item belongs appears.



The first data record of the current sorting order from the database

toolbox is displayed automatically. If the table is empty, then an

empty mask appears.



The mask of the table that was defined first in @{Designer ignore} will be used

in each case. But you can also change the mask to suit your wishes

(see Change mask command).



A mask window is divided into four areas:

@autorefoff

- Title line

- Menu-bar, and icon bar buttons (at top edge of window)

- Info line

- Working area



@{U}Title line@{u}

@autorefon

The title line of the window displays the database and table names,

separated by a point.



@{U}Menu-bar, and icon bar buttons@{u}

The menu-bar, as well as the icon bar buttons that duplicate some of

the menu entries, can be serviced with either the left or right mouse

button. When you click on a menu, it drops down; then this menu can be

used in the same way as the main menu at the top edge of the screen.



In the icon bar below the info line you can alter the index key in

the listbox and the sorting direction with the @{B}+/-@{b} buttons.

In addition there are icon buttons which perform commands in the mask

window.

The icon bar of a mask window can be hidden or revealed in DESIGNER

for each mask individually by using the appropriate checkbox in the

@{Info ignore} function of @{Designer ignore}'s @{"mask window" LINK "DESIGNER.HYP/Dialogbox Masken-Info"}.



You can also newly define there the buttons that you really need.



@{U}@{Info ignore} line@{u}

Below the menu bar lies the info line. This shows the criterium by

which the displayed data records are currently sorted.



The info line of a mask window too can be hidden or revealed in

DESIGNER for each mask individually by using the appropriate checkbox

in the @{Info ignore} function of @{Designer ignore}'s @{"mask window" LINK "DESIGNER.HYP/Dialogbox Masken-Info"}.



@{U}Working area@{u}

This displays the mask and serves for constructing or modifying data

records;  the input will be to the field that contains the cursor,

which can be positioned directly in any desired field with a mouse

click. If this is a Text field, then the cursor will be placed on the

character that was clicked on.



In most cases the cursor will be displayed as a black block. For

graphics fields, @{"BLOB" LINK "DESIGNER.HYP/Data types" 72}'s, radio buttons as well as checkboxes it

will be depicted as a dotted frame (around the field).



If a field is defined as an output field, or if the access protection

@{B}Read only@{b} was defined for the field, then the cursor will jump over

this field. A double-click on a field of the @{"External file" LINK "DESIGNER.HYP/Data types" 40} data type

has the same effect as the Display field command. An attempt will be

made to display the external file in a window, or to replay the sound

if it is a suitable sound sample file.



Left-clicking on a field while holding down the [Alternate] key allows

you to mark fields. The name or label of the field will be displayed

in light type (greyed out). The contents of a marked field is not

deleted after inserting the data record and is available for further

input.



If you want to mark fields of a mask permanently, then you can set

this in DESIGNER in the @{"Field attributes dialog-box" LINK "DESIGNER.HYP/Dialogbox Feldattribute"} with the switch

B}Retain when inserting@{b}.



Double-clicking on a field while holding down the [Alternate] key

brings up the @{"Branch dialog-box" LINK "Dialogbox Verzweigen"}.





Below is a listing of the keys that trigger some special actions. We

can distinguish between general and type-dependent keys. The general

keys apply to the whole mask no matter where the cursor is positioned,

while the type-dependent keys apply for a field of a given data type

containing the cursor.

@{U}Dragging from table windows@{u}

Data records from a @{"table window" LINK "Tabellen-Fenster"} can be dragged to a mask window. The

effect depends on whether the table and mask windows originated from

the same table or not:



   ˘ From same table:

     The data record from the table window will be copied to the mask

     window and displayed in it.



   ˘ From a table window that was a value table for the mask:

     If the data record comes from the table window of a value table

     of the mask window, then all values will be adopted automatically

     that were set in the definition in @{"Designer" LINK "DESIGNER.HYP/Value tables"}. In this way you can

     put the postcode and town from a value table directly into the

     mask, for instance.



     If a value table is used in several fields of the same mask, then

     the mouse cursor must be positioned exactly on the corresponding

     field of the mask that is to be filled from the value table.

The display scale of the preview can be chosen in a popup.

Alternatively, a left-click in the window enlarges the scale by one

@{U}3.10  Process window                                   PHOENIX Manager@{u}



The process window window opens when a process is being executed. Its

title line shows what kind of action is being performed at the time.



The first line in the window shows the path and file being written to.

If it concerns the printer, then the name of the interface port will

be displayed. For some processes it may be left empty.



The second line shows the database and the table taking part in the

action.



The third line - if present - shows the columns used for producing

the sorted output and the sorting order.



@{U}Time information:@{u}



 @{B}Running@{b} shows how long the process has been running already

     (hours:minutes:seconds).

 @{B}Remaining@{b} shows approximately how much longer the process will run

     (hours:minutes:seconds).

 @{B}Pause@{b} serves to block the process for an indefinite time. The

     switch can not be activated when the process is blocked by the

     Manager.

 @{B}Exclusive@{b} is a switch whose activation allocates the complete CPU

     calculation time to the process; all other processes are paused.

     This state of affairs is terminated by clicking with either mouse

     button on the checkbox.



 @{B}Data record@{b} shows which data record the processing has reached. If

     the running process is the spooler, then instead of 'Data record'

     the word 'Bytes' will be displayed.



Below the data record field is a bar which shows the progress of the

action visually.

The bar wanders from left to right and gives a rough overview how far

processing has progressed. Above the bar are the two limiting values.

At the left is a 0, at the right the maximum number of data records

in the current table or the number of bytes when dealing with the

spooler. During importing the upper limit floats.



@autorefoff

 @{B}Iconize@{b} serves to shrink the process to a minimum size, so that it

@autorefon

     does not require so much space on the desktop (see @{"Process icon" LINK "Prozeû-Sinnbild"}).



@{I}Note:@{i}

If a process for a database is running, then this database can not be

closed. Should you want to do this nevertheless, then all processes

that pertain to this database must be aborted. For the same reason it

is not possible to terminate the program, since this closes all the

databases. The same applies for calling up other programs, since this

might mean quitting the Manager for the time being.



A process can be aborted also by pressing the [Esc] or [@{Undo ignore}] key.

@{U}3.11  Properties window                                PHOENIX Manager@{u}



A properties window opens when you double-click on an item or area

(such as the headers, footers or detail areas, or the rulers) in a

@{"report window" LINK "Bericht-Fenster"}. Depending on the what you have clicked on, the main

part of the window displays various @{"properties" LINK "The properties"} or attributes of the

item or area that may be altered here, with their current status.



Click on the property you want to change to select it. The current

value appears in the long field above the listed properties, followed

by one of two kinds of cursor: If this is a solid rectangle, then you

can type in a new value into the field and press [Return] to insert it

in the table and modify the item in the report. Note that you @{I}must@{i}

use a comma instead of a decimal point as a separator for numbers

with decimal places.



If the cursor is a hollow rectangle, the field turns into a listbox

and clicking on the small arrow box at far right drops down a list of

options from which you can make your selection. (An exception is the

@{B}@{Font ignore}@{b} entry, where the box shows three dots and clicking on it opens

the @{"Font dialog-box" LINK "Dialogbox Schriftart"} where you can choose both the type and size of

font, as well as any font attributes). A click on one of the listbox

entries will insert it in the relevant field of the @{"Properties" LINK "The properties"} list

@{U}3.12  Query window                                     PHOENIX Manager@{u}



A query window can be created by using the NewQuery command in the

Process menu (or its equivalent in the function key bar), or by the

Open command as long as a data record in a @{"query-list window" LINK "Abfrageliste-Fenster"} has

been selected.



The window serves to put a query to a database without having to learn

a query language first. For this reason such a query is also called

QBE, meaning query By example.



The window's title line shows the name of the database and the name

of the table.



@autorefoff

The info line shows the name of the current query. Hence it will be

empty when dealing with a new query.

@autorefon



The icon bar can be used to call the change sorting order (@{B}+/-@{b}) and

Complement columns (crossed<->uncrossed box)  functions.



Complementing changes the columns that are to be output at a query,

namely:

- Selected columns will be deselected

- Deselected columns will be selected



@{I}Tip:@{i}

If the command is called accidentally, then a repeat call can anul

its effect and restore the original selection.



The sorting can be specified by up to 16 steps. More about this in

the @{"Sorting dialog-box" LINK "Dialogbox Sortierung"}.



The column names lie below the info line. Under each column name there

is a checkbox switch indicating whether the column is to be output or

not. In addition, next to the switch it is noted whether this field is

to be taken account of during sorting or not.



Below this there are 16 lines which are to take the conditions.



@{U}Selection of columns (fields)@{u}

Selection of the columns is done by turning on or off the checkbox

switch allocated to each column, lying just below the column name.

Instead of clicking on the checkbox to change it, you can also click

on the column name.



Complementing of all columns is also possible via the corresponding

icon.



@{U}Setting the column order@{u}

The order of the columns can be changed in the same way as for a table

window. Just click on the column name with the left mouse button and

hold down the button while dragging it to the new position.



@{I}Note:@{i}

If an old query is loaded, then you will find left to right first

those columns that are to be output, as it is assumed that these will

be the columns of greatest interest.



@{U}Setting the column width@{u}

This is done in exactly the same way as for a table window, i.e. by

left-clicking on the solid dividing line at the top of the column and

dragging it to a new position while holding down the mouse key. During

this a small box shows the @{B}Width@{b} of the column and the @{B}Total@{b} width.

As for table windows the option is offered here to double-click on a

column name to open the @{"Column width dialog-box" LINK "Dialogbox Spaltenbreite"}.



@{U}Formulating the conditions@{u}

Formulation of the conditions is performed in the individual fields

of the matrix.

The following applies: All columns of a line are combined with a

logical AND. Individual lines in turn are combined with a logical OR.



The following mathematical relations can occur in a field:

{Maskname.Fieldname}  Field contents as query parameter



[...] here means for instance [b-d], which selects all terms from 'b'

up to 'd' inclusive. This has the same meaning as BETWEEN 'b' AND 'd'.



{Any text} represents a text that is displayed in a dialog-box, and

for whose field the value can then be set interactively.



{Maskname.Fieldname} represents the field name of an open mask. The

value input there will be used for the query.



After a relation you have to specify the comparison value. Comparison

will be made with the column in which the condition has been entered.



The following joker characters can be used for conditions in text

fields:



@{I}Character  Meaning @{i}

@Line 1 44 0 0 1

*          Any character-string (also empty)

?          Just one character of any kind

#          Any numeral



The joker '?' can also be used in Date fields to select individual

components. So ??.11.?? in a 'Birthday' field represents all persons

that have as birthday in November.



@{I}Note:@{i}

A single quote-mark (') may appear in a query condition only as a

separator of character-strings, not within a character-string.



If a query is to be formulated in which a single quote-mark appears

then a double-quote (") can be used as a separator.



@{U}Specifying the sorting order@{u}

The sorting order is specified via the Sorting order icon (@{B}+/-@{b}).

As an alternative it can be called also by a double right-click on

any field.



The command Execute starts a query. This process runs in the back-

ground. The sorting is performed exclusively.

Following this a @{"table window" LINK "Tabellen-Fenster"} is opened with the result. If the

@{B}Number of records for query@{b} switch in the @{"Configuration dialog-box" LINK "Dialogbox Konfiguration"}

is turned on then, before the window opens, an info-box shows the

number of data records found.

@{U}3.13  Query-list window [F6]                          PHOENIX Manager@{u}



This is a @{"table window" LINK "Tabellen-Fenster"} in which the names of the queries are shown.

If the window is enlarged, then the queries themselves can be looked

at as @{"SQL" LINK "Sidebar: SQL"} commands. The window has some additional features:



If a data record in this window is selected then the following actions

can be performed:

- Left double-click: Calling the Open command

- Right double-click: Calling the Execute command



When performing the @{B}Open@{b} command, unlike for normal table windows

this does not open a mask window, but a @{"query window" LINK "Abfrage-Fenster"} instead. This

window then contains the previously selected data record, making it

possible to modify previously saved queries. Should you nevertheless

want to define a query via a normal @{"mask window" LINK "Masken-Fenster"} (though this should

not be necessary as a rule), then after selection you can call the

Edit data command, which makes a mask appear.

@toc "The windows"

@{U}3.14  Report window                                    PHOENIX Manager@{u}



A report window can be created by using the NewReport command in

the Process menu (or its equivalent in the function key bar), as well

as the Open command as long as a data record in a report-list window

is selected during this.



The window's title line shows the name of the report. If the report

has not been saved yet, it will display <Unnamed>.



For certain actions the info line below this will display coordinates

such as mouse position or the @{B}X@{b} and @{B}Y@{b} positions and @{B}Size@{b} of the

item that is being created.



Below the info line lies an icon bar, whose icons perform the

following functions:



@Image "ARROW.IMG" 1

## oder fuer Farbaufloesungen:

## @IMAGE "ARROW_C.IMG" 1

      With the arrow you can manipulate previously created items.

      You can alter the position of an object by dragging it with

      the  mouse. You can also alter the size of the object by first

selecting it and then grabbing one of the 'handles' (small squares

at the 4 corners and mid-points) and moving it with the mouse. After

placing an object you will be returned to this mode automatically,

unless you have activated the Lock icon (see below).



@Image "A.IMG" 1

## oder fuer Farbaufloesungen:

## @IMAGE "A_C.IMG" 1

      If this icon is activated, you can create a text object. Such

      text objects can accommodate texts that do not change and are

      not data record dependent. The object is created by dragging

out a frame with the mouse. You can also use @{"calculation commands" LINK "Calculation commands"}

in text objects.



@Image "AB.IMG" 1

## oder fuer Farbaufloesungen:

## @IMAGE "AB_C.IMG" 1

      This tool creates a placeholder for the data field selected

      in the @{B}Field@{b} popup to the right of the icons. Here too you

      can set the size and position of the placeholder by dragging

out a rectangle with the mouse. A second rectangle appears automati-

cally to the left of the placeholder containing the field name; you

can use this as a label if desired, or delete it immediately by

selecting it and pressing the [@{Delete ignore}] key.



@Image "XYZ.IMG" 1

## oder fuer Farbaufloesungen:

## @IMAGE "XYZ_C.IMG 1

      If you activate this icon you can create a grouping frame with

      which you can surround several items to improve clarity.

      The name of the active field will be used as a heading; however,

you can also input any other text here by double-clicking on the

heading and  pressing [Return] after typing in your text. Both the

frame and the heading will appear in the finished report.



@Image "RADIO.IMG" 1

## oder fuer Farbaufloesungen:

## @IMAGE "RADIO_C.IMG" 1

      This icon produces a radio button which, depending on the @{B}Value@{b}

      set in the @{"properties window" LINK "Eigenschaften-Fenster"}, appears switched on or off in the

      report output to screen or printer (see Property: Value).

      The text next to it is that selected in the @{B}Field@{b} popup, but

      you can change it in the same way as for the grouping frame

      heading above.



@Image "CHECK.IMG" 1

## oder fuer Farbaufloesungen:

## @IMAGE "CHECK_C.IMG" 1

      This icon is similar to the radio button but with the difference

      that a checkbox will be drawn.



@Image "LINE.IMG" 1

## oder fuer Farbaufloesungen:

## @IMAGE "LINE_C.IMG" 1

      With this icon selected you can draw horizontal and vertical

      lines. This is very useful for dividing lines in tables, for

      instance.



@Image "RECTANG.IMG" 1

## oder fuer Farbaufloesungen:

## @IMAGE "REACTANGC.IMG" 1

      This tool creates a rectangle. The colour, drawing mode and

      frame style can be set freely in the @{"properties window" LINK "Eigenschaften-Fenster"}.



@Image "GRAPHIC.IMG" 1

## oder fuer Farbaufloesungen:

## @IMAGE "GRAPHICC.IMG" 1

      This tool is intended to allow graphics to be incorporated in

      reports in the future. In PHOENIX 5.4 this function could not

      yet be realised, unfortunately, hence the icon is not selectable

(shown by its greyed-out state).



@Image "SUBREP.IMG" 1

## oder fuer Farbaufloesungen:

## @IMAGE "SUBREPC.IMG" 1

      With this tool you can draw up a frame in which a so-called

      Sub-report is displayed. For this you have to know that the

      report function can combine several reports with each other.



@Image "LOCK.IMG" 1

## oder fuer Farbaufloesungen:

## @IMAGE "LOCK_C.IMG" 1

      As soon as you activate the padlock, the currently selected tool

      icon remains active until you switch manually to a different

      icon. Thus after the creation of a new object you are no longer

switched back automatically to the manipulation mode (Arrow icon).

This is useful if you want to create several fields of the same type

one after the other in the report.



@Image "NAME.IMG" 1

## oder fuer Farbaufloesungen:

## @IMAGE "NAME_C.IMG" 1

                 The @{B}Field@{b} popup contains the fields of the table

                 that functions as the data source for the report.

Clicking on the entry drops down a listbox allowing you to choose

the desired field to appear for the selected tool function.



@Image "100.IMG" 1

## oder fuer Farbaufloesungen:

## @IMAGE "100_C.IMG" 1

        In the last popup of the icon bar you can enlarge or reduce

        the scale at which the report will be displayed on-screen.





A report is subdivided into several areas:



 @{B}Page header@{b}:    All items in this area will be output at the

                 start of each new page. This makes the page header

                 very suitable for displaying the header line for a

                 list, for instance.

 @{B}Report header@{b}:  The report header will be output just once at the

                 start of the report. With this you can realise cover

                 sheets or main headings, for instance.

 @{B}Detail area@{b}:    The detail area is the heart of every report.

                 It will be output for every data record.

 @{B}Report footer@{b}:  Just like the report header, the report footer will

                 be output just once at the end of the report.

 @{B}Page footer@{b}:    The page footer will be output at the end of each

                 page. Here you can accommodate a running page number,

                 for instance.



You can switch the Page header/footer and Report header/footer areas

on or off with the Page head/footer and Report head/footer entries of

the report menu.



The various attributes of a report's items are controlled via the

so-called @{"properties window" LINK "Eigenschaften-Fenster"}, which appears when you double-click on

a report item or area.



A report is activated with the Execute command. In addition it is

possible to drag a table, a @{"table icon" LINK "Tabellen-Sinnbild"} or individual data records from a

a @{"table window" LINK "Tabellen-Fenster"} directly into the report window and drop them there.

The effect of this is that the report in this window will be executed

with these data records. The report window need not necessarily be

topped for this.



First a preview of the report will be displayed in a @{"preview window" LINK "Vorschau-Fenster"}.

If you are satisfied with the result, you can start a printout with

the File/Print menu entry, or by clicking on the Printer icon in the

Manager icon bar.



If you want to print immediately and skip the preview, then if the

report window is active you can click on the Printer icon straight

away, or use File/Print.

@toc "The windows"

@{U}3.15  Report-list window [F7]                         PHOENIX Manager@{u}



This window opens when you activate ListReport in the Process menu.

It will either be empty, or display the entries of previously prepared

reports and sub-reports. It is a special form of a @{"table window" LINK "Tabellen-Fenster"}.



The title line of the window shows the database used for the report.



Below the title line lies the info line. It shows by which criteria

any displayed reports are currently sorted. On a new report-list this

will be 'Name' and '+' (for ascending order).



If reports and/or sub-reports have been prepared previously, then in

the icon bar under the info line you can change the sorting direction

with the @{B}+@{b} and @{B}-@{b} buttons. The binoculars (Search) icon has no

applications in this window; the mask icon calls the Edit data

function, opening the relevant SYSTEM mask where you can modify the

entries (but normally you will not want to do this).



Under the icon bar is the header line of the table, showing the names

of the columns. Below this the individual reports and sub-reports are

displayed line by line.



The following operations can be performed with the window:



@{U}Iconize@{u}

With the Iconize command of the Edit menu or its equivalent in the

function key bar a table can be converted to a @{"table icon" LINK "Tabellen-Sinnbild"}.



@{U}Selection of reports/sub-reports@{u}

A left mouse-click selects a report entry and displays it in inverse

video.



You can execute all commands on the selected reports that take effect

on reports, although only a few can be applied sensibly.



A double left-click on a report or sub-report opens the @{"Report window" LINK "Bericht-Fenster"}

displaying the individual elements of the report, which can then be

modified if required. A double right-click has the same effect as the

Execute command in the Process menu, creating a preview of the report

in the @{"Preview window" LINK "Vorschau-Fenster"} which can then be printed if desired.

@toc "The windows"

@{U}3.16  Table window                                     PHOENIX Manager@{u}



A table window can be created with the Open table command of the

Edit menu, amongst others.



The title line of the window shows the database and the table from

which the data records originate.

If the window is a result of a named query, then its name will be

appended within brackets. Should it be an Auto-query, then an excla-

mation mark in brackets '(!)' will be output. An Auto-query is a

query that has the same name as a table.



Below the title line lies the info line. It shows by which criteria

the displayed data records are currently sorted.



In the icon bar under the info line you can change the index in the

listbox and the sorting direction with the @{B}+@{b} and @{B}-@{b} buttons. The other

two icons (the binoculars and the mask respectively) call the Search

and Edit data functions.



Under the icon bar is the header line of the table, showing the names

of the columns. Below this the individual data records are displayed

line by line.



The following operations can be performed with the window:



@{U}Iconize@{u}

With the Iconize command of the Edit menu or its equivalent in the

function key bar a table can be converted to a @{"table icon" LINK "Tabellen-Sinnbild"}.



@{U}Selection and moving of data records@{u}

A left mouse-click selects a data record and displays it in inverse

video. Further data records can be selected by holding down a [Shift]

key, or deselected again the same way.

By pressing and holding down the left mouse button while the mouse

pointer is in the left margin of the table, you can drag out a rubber

band rectangle to select all data records that the rubber banded area

overlays. By holding down a [Shift] key during the operation the

selected data records will be deselected and vice versa.

If you hold down the [Control] key during this you can select some

additional data records.



You can execute all commands on the selected data records that take

effect on data records. In addition, the selected data records can be

dragged onto all items of the Manager's desktop for which an operation

is defined. This is explained in @{"The Manager's desktop" LINK "Schreibtisch des Managers"} section.



A double-click on the selected data records has the same effect as

the Edit data command in the Edit menu. Furthermore the data records

can be dragged to a free place on the desktop, when they will be

converted into a @{"table-clipboard icon" LINK "Tabellenklemmbrett-Sinnbild"}. This will cause the appearance

of the @{"Clipboard name dialog-box" LINK "Dialogbox Klemmbrett-Name"}, where you can assign it another name

to differentiate it from the table name shown by default.



@{U}Changing the column selection@{u}

A column will be removed from the display if you drag the column name

to the wastebin. Alternatively you can just right-click on the column

name to achieve this.



@{U}Changing the column order@{u}

A column can be moved to another position by dragging the column name

to a different place.

Drag to the right: It appears after the column at which the mouse

button was released.

Drag to the left: If appears before the column at which the mouse

button was released.



@{U}Changing the column widths@{u}

Left-click on the vertical separation line between the column headers

and drag the line in the desired direction.  During this a small box

shows the @{B}Width@{b} of the column and the @{B}Total@{b} width. Alternatively you

can double-click either mouse button on the header of a column to

open the @{"Column width dialog-box" LINK "Dialogbox Spaltenbreite"}, where you can set a new width.



@{U}Changing the sorting@{u}

If only the sorting order is to be changed (ascending to descending or

vice versa), then call the Reverse sort command in the Options menu.

If the table is to be displayed sorted by a different index, then this

can be selected in the index listbox popup in the icon bar. With some

windows the sorting order can not be changed.



@{U}Searching@{u}

If you want to jump to a given data record in a table window, then

you have to select the Search command in the Edit menu or click on

the binocular icon. This opens the @{"Search dialog-box" LINK "Dialogbox Suchen"}.



@{I}Note:@{i}

A single column in a table window can have a maximum width of 255

characters. If it is wider, it will be truncated to 255 characters.



@{U}Pictures and BLOBs@{u}

Columns that can not be displayed are replaced by the '*' character.

These types include all images and the @{"BLOBs" LINK "DESIGNER.HYP/Data types" 72}. Columns that overflow

are replaced by the '#' character. An overflow occurs, for instance,

if a format was specified for a Number field in which there is not

enough room to accommodate the current number.

@{U}3.18  Template window                                  PHOENIX Manager@{u}



A template is a kind of stencil which, besides normal text, can

contain placeholders for fields from the database. This stencil can

be combined (mixed) with default data records, so that each record

results in a discrete template.



A template window can be created by using the NewTemplate command in

the Process menu, as well as by the Open command as long as a data

record is selected in a @{"template-list window" LINK "Reportliste-Fenster"} during this.



The window's title line displays the name of the database.



The info line shows the current name of the template. Hence it will

be empty when dealing with a new template.



Below the info line are three popup listboxes. The first (@{B}Table@{b}) lets

you select the table, the second to choose a @{B}Field@{b} and the third

to select an @{B}Index@{b}.



The second and third popup listbox always offers the choice of the

fields and indices of the table selected in the first listbox.



Below this is an icon bar which can be used to enter a definition at

the current cursor position. The icons have the following meaning:



@image "TMPLICN.IMG" 0

## Oder fuer Farbaufloesungen

## @image "TMPLICNC.IMG" 0





                     1   2   3   4    5   6   7

   ˘ 4  Current counter (COUNT)



   ˘ 5  Branch (>)

   ˘ 6  Branch return (<)

   ˘ 7  Summing (+)



The rest of the window serves for definition of the template. It takes

the form of a simple text editor in which the template can be entered.

Apart from typing in your text, you can click on one of the drop-down

entries in the @{B}Field@{b} listbox to insert it at the current cursor; it

will be converted to the contents of the corresponding field in each

data record. Trying this with the @{B}Index@{b} drop-down entries results

only in the text of the entry appearing in the final template output.



Clicking on one of the icons inserts a placeholder which will be

converted to its current value at runtime.



Fields of the database must be prefixed with a '{' character.

The abbreviations for header and footer lines ($P etc.) correspond to

the variables in the @{"Page format dialog-box" LINK "Dialogbox Seitenformat"}.



The abbreviations for font attributes ($BREIT etc.) use the entries

of the printer driver. You can use only those abbreviations that are

defined in the printer driver. You can recognise this from the fact

that the corresponding buttons in the @{"Printer parameters dialog-box" LINK "Dialogbox Drucker-Parameter"}

are active (i.e. not greyed out).



If we are dealing with a list definition, then all data records will

be output one after the other, with no formfeed between the individual

data records.



@{U}Activating the listboxes from the keyboard@{u}

- [Shift]+[F3] drops down the @{B}Table@{b} listbox

- [Shift]+[F4] drops down the @{B}Field@{b} listbox

- [Shift]+[F5] drops down the @{B}Index@{b} listbox



A template is activated with the Execute command. In addition it is

possible to drag a table, a @{"table icon" LINK "Tabellen-Sinnbild"} or individual data records from a

a @{"table window" LINK "Tabellen-Fenster"} directly into the template window and drop them there.

The effect of this is that the template in this window will be execu-

ted with these data records. The template window need not necessarily

be topped for this.



@{I}Note:@{i}

At times (specially when @{"summing" LINK "Summing"} numeric fields) the intended field

is too small to contain the summed total. For instance, if there are

only three places defined in the format for a numeric field, then this

field can only display a maximum of three places, i.e. numbers up to

999. In the case of an overflow the numbers will be replaced by the

character '#', just as in table windows. This is because the sum also

uses the same format. IN that case the default format should be over-

written as described above.

With the command '{$SQL=...}' an SQL statement can be executed, with

which you defined the data from the branching table more exactly.



When using the simple branching operation '{>}' it is only possible

to @{"branch" LINK "Branch"} to a table via an index. From this table all data records

that are present for this index will be output sequentially (i.e. in

the order they were input). This should certainly suffice for most

tasks. However, if a given type of sorting of data records in the

branching table is required, or if selection is to take place via

more complex criteria, you have to use the SQL command.



Sidebar: SQL



Like the branching operator, the SQL command can be inserted at any

desired place in the template:



{$SQL="SQL statement"}



SQL statement here is a character-string enclosed in double quotes,

which must be built up as follows (the SQL keywords are displayed

in bold):



"@{B}SELECT * FROM@{b} Table_name @{B}WHERE@{b} Field_name1=Value1 @{B}OR@{b} Field_name2=Value2

@{B}ORDER BY@{b} Field_name1 @{B}ASC@{b}, Field_name2 @{B}DESC@{b}"



The first part of the SQL command is always the same: SELECT * FROM.

This is followed by the name of the table from which the data are

to be fetched: Table_name. Following the keyword WHERE you formulate

the conditions that the data records of the destination table should

fulfill.

Condition linkages available are the two operators OR and AND.

Comparison operators available are <, =, > and <>. Optionally you

can also set a sorting order for the branch table. For this you can

enter after ORDER BY the sorting criteria, separated by commas. The

sorting criterium consists of a field name followed by ASC (ascending)

or DESC (descending). Specifying the sorting order is not mandatory

(default is ASC).



If you want to emulate simple branching via an SQL command then in

place of (Source_index>Destination_table.Destination_index) write:

{$SQL="SELECT * FROM Destination_table WHERE

Destination_index=Source_table.Source_index"}

You should note here that following WHERE you must always specify

the table name before the field name, unless this is a field in the

destination table.



If the data of the destination table are to be sorted according to a

given value, you would write:

{$SQL="SELECT * FROM Destination_table WHERE

Destination_index=Source_table.Source_index ORDER BY Field_name ASC"}



Following the SQL command you can use the fields of the destination

table in the template. In addition the fields of the parent tables

can be output directly. If names are duplicated, you can access a

field of the source table by specifying additionally the table name:

(Table_name.Field_name)



SQL branching is terminated by a branch return ({<}) command.

@node "Summing"

@toc "Report-Fenster"

@{U}3.17.2  Summing                                        PHOENIX Manager@{u}



During the processing of a template there is a possibility to add up

all numeric fields. This sum can be output at the end of the template

or a branching process.



This is done with the '+' character.



@{I}Example:@{i}



     {Tape:3} {Remaining} min.

     {+}------------

      {Remaining:5} min.



All tapes with their remaining time are to be output in a list. After

this the total remaining time is to be output.

Result (for the first seven tapes):



     001  180 min.

     002   45 min.

     003    2 min.

     004   10 min.

     005    5 min.

     006   10 min.

     007    5 min.

     -------------

          257 min.



As you can see, the template definition will run through each tape.

However, not the whole definition will be used, but only that up to

the '+' character. The following part will be output only once at the

end (i.e. not for every tape).



It is also possible to sum numeric fields of data records while pro-

cessing a branch. The summing process then starts anew for each branch.



In the following example all tapes should be output with their titles

and playing time. The playing time of each title on one tape should be

added up, so that at the end of each tape its total playing time is

output.



The template definition has the following form:



Tape: {Tape}

------------

No. Title Playlength

-----------------------------

{Tape > VIDEO}

{COUNT:2}, {Title:-20} {Playlength}{+}

-----------------------------

Total: {Playlength:21}

{<}

@xref "The properties"

@{U}4.1.47  Property: Text                                 PHOENIX Manager@{u}



This appears in the @{"properties window" LINK "Eigenschaften-Fenster"} when you double-click on a text

frame. It permits the output of any desired fixed texts that you can

type into the field at the top of the table. The field will scroll

automatically for long texts.



Apart from this, you can also use the Text property for performing

calculations. There are three options for this:



Simple, one-line calculations can be typed in directly. They have to

start with an equality sign ('='). This is particularly useful when

data from various fields have to be collected together, say to build

up the salutation for a letter. If you were to assemble this from

several items, you would probably get some ugly gaps between the

individual objects.



@{I}Example:@{i}

="Sehr geehrte"+Anrede+" "+Vorname+" "+Nachname

or in English:

="Dear"+@{Title ignore}+" "+Forename+" "+Surname



As usual with calculations, fixed texts have to be enclosed in double-

quotes, while the field names can be typed in directly.



More complex calculations have to be input in a @{"calculation window" LINK "Rechnen-Fenster"}

and saved. They are called with the equality sign followed by the '@@'

character and the name of the calculation. The calculation must use

the function RETURN to return the result that is to be inserted into

the report. Further information about this in the @{"calculation window" LINK "Rechnen-Fenster"}

page.



@{I}Example:@{i}

=@@Calculation for report



Short calculations for which it is not really worth while to construct

and save a calculation, but which contain more than one command, can

be accommodated in a Text field via a trick: The equality sign can be

followed also by a complete calculation. This has to be prefaced by a

variable declaration (VAR). This is followed by the individual assign-

ments, separated by a semicolon in each case. At the end there has to

be a RETURN assignment to insert the calculation result into the

report.

If you want to change the display in the listboxes, click with the

right mouse button in a free space in the toolbox. A popup menu will

appear offering the following sorting criteria:



@{B}By name@{b}:

  Tables and indices will be displayed sorted by their names.

@{B}By number@{b}:

  Tables and indices will be displayed sorted by their number, i.e.

  in the order in which they were laid down in @{Designer ignore}.

Select the desired sorting method with a right-click on the relevant

popup entry.



In each case only the display of the current database is affected, so

that switching to another database the setting last valid there will

be retained.

The index 'Sequentiell' (= Sequential) is always displayed as the

first index entry, no matter whether you choose sorting @{B}By name@{b} or

@{B}By number@{b}.

record set to which the calculation is applied can be defined in

several ways:



  1. If no item is selected on the desktop or in a @{"table window" LINK "Tabellen-Fenster"},

     then the calculation will be performed for all data records of

  2. If a @{"table icon" LINK "Tabellen-Sinnbild"} or a @{"table-clipboard icon" LINK "Tabellenklemmbrett-Sinnbild"} is selected

     on the desktop, then the calculation will be performed for all

     data records of this icon.

  3. If some data records in a table window are selected, then the

     calculation will be performed with all selected data records.



To execute a calculation you can also drag a table from the database

toolbox, a table icon, or data records from a table window onto the

If a @{"template window" LINK "Report-Fenster"} is topped, then this template will be executed.

If a @{"table icon" LINK "Tabellen-Sinnbild"} or data records in a table are

selected, then Manager attempts to combine these data records with the

template, i.e. execute the template on these data records. If no

items are selected, then the table specified in the template will be

used as the data source.



A template can be executed only if does not contain any errors. If

errors occur, then they will be reported in an error-box, offering the

opportunity to correct them. The execution of a template runs as a

background process.



Before executing the template you must specify whether the template is

to be output to the @{B}Screen@{b}, a @{B}Printer@{b}, or to a @{B}File@{b}.



@{I}Note:@{i}

If the template is present in the 1st Word Plus format, then it has to

be output to a file, since the Manager can not print the Wordplus

format directly. However the template output file retains the Wordplus

attributes (bold, undeerscored etc.) as well as any incorporated

graphics. This file can be printed out later in the 1st Word Plus

program.

the GEM clipboard. This icon appears @{I}only@{i} when the desk accessory

CLIPBRD.ACC is installed on the computer.



To transfer a table to the GEM clipboard you have to drag it onto the

Clipboard icon. In addition it is possible to transfer individual data

records of a table to a file in the GEM clipboard by selecting it in a

window and then dragging it onto the Clipboard icon. Then a file named

SCRAP.TXT will be created in the current GEM clipboard directory; this

is normally CLIPBRD in the root of drive C:. If such a file exists

already, it will be overwritten.



The format of this file corresponds to the format that would result if

the data records were exported to this file in ASCII format. Further

information about this can be found in the Export command chapter.



A double-click with the left mouse button opens the clipboard. This

then displays the contents of the GEM clipboard in a @{"clipboard window" LINK "Klemmbrett-Fenster"}.

The process icon appears when a @{"process window" LINK "Prozeû-Fenster"} is iconized. This is

achieved by using the @{B}@{Iconize ignore}@{b} button in the window, or executing the

Iconize command in the Edit menu when a process window is active. A

process icon always takes the name of the table taking part in the

process. An exception is the printer spooler, which always carries the

name SPOOLER.



A process window is created when an action is executed that takes some

time to compete. Such an action runs first in the background, so that

you can continue to work unhindered. These actions include:

- @{"Deletion" LINK "Delete"} of data records

- Restoration of data records

- Output of tables to a file

- @{"Printing" LINK "Print"} tables

- @{"Exporting" LINK "Export"} data records

- @{"Importing" LINK "Import"} data records

- Evaluation of queries

- Outputting reports and templates

- Automatic calculation of data



@{I}Note:@{i}

You should bear in mind that background processes require a large

amount of processing power. When such a process is running, then it

may happen - particularly with less powerful hardware and output to

floppy disk - that mouse operations become a little sluggish and the

computer no longer appears to react quickly enough. In particular, a

double-click of the mouse is then often skipped by the computer and

evaluated as two single-clicks. However, instead of a double-click

you can always use the Open command.



A maximum of six processes may run simultaneously.



A double-click on the icon with the left mouse button will open the

process window.



A double-click on the icon with the right mouse button will activate

the Info command.



A single click with the right mouse button makes a popup menu appear

with the three commands Info, Open a Remove. You can activate any of

these with a right-click.



 @{B}Info@{b}        shows current information about the process. It has the

             same effect as the Info command in the Help main menu.

 @{B}Open@{b}        opens the associated @{"process window" LINK "Prozeû-Fenster"}. It has the same

             effect as the Open command in the File main menu when a

             process icon is selected.

 @{B}Remove@{b}      terminates the process prematurely. It has the same

             effect as the Remove command in the Edit main menu.



After the completion or termination of a process its associated icon,

if present, vanishes automatically from the dektop without having to

activate a special command for this.

@{U}9.6  Table icon                                        PHOENIX Manager@{u}



The table icon appears when a @{"table window" LINK "Tabellen-Fenster"} (list window) is iconized.

Such a window can be created with the Open table command. The result

of a query is also a table (or a @{"table-clipboard" LINK "table-clipboard window"}).



A maximum of 18 such icons (together with @{"table-clipboard icons" LINK "Tabellenklemmbrett-Sinnbild"}) can

be placed on the desktop.



A double-click on the icon with the left mouse button will open the

table window.



A double-click on the icon with the right mouse button will activate

the Info command.



@autorefoff

A single click with the @{I}right@{i} mouse button makes a popup menu appear

with the three commands @{B}Info@{b}, @{B}Open@{b} and @{B}Remove@{b}. You can activate any

of these with a @{I}right-click.@{i}

@autorefon



 @{B}Info@{b}        shows current information about the table window. It has

             the same effect as the Info command in the Help main

             menu.

 @{B}Open@{b}        opens the associated @{"table window" LINK "Tabellen-Fenster"}. It has the same

             effect as the Open command in the File main menu when a

             table icon is selected.

 @{B}Remove@{b}      Removes the icon from the dektop. It has the same

             effect as the Remove command in the Edit main menu.

@{U}9.7  Table-clipboard icon                              PHOENIX Manager@{u}



The table-clipboard icon appears when a @{"table window" LINK "Tabellen-Fenster"} (list window)

that displays an extract from a table is iconized. Such extracts can

be created as an icon by dragging data records from a table window

onto the desktop, or if a query is started which returns a portion

of an existing table; such a partial set results when some of the

search criteria do not apply to all of the data records.



The way this icon is used corresponds to that for the @{"table icon" LINK "Tabellen-Sinnbild"}. The

only exception is that you can not drag the icon onto the wastebin

icon or onto other table-clipboard icons.



Double-clicking the icon will open a table-clipboard window that

displays the data records that were extracted from the original table.

Alternatively you can select the icon and then activate Open in the

File menu, or right-click on it and then on @{B}@{Open ignore}@{b} in the popup.



A maximum of 18 such icons (together with table icons) can be placed

on the desktop.

@{U}10  Sidebar: SQL                                       PHOENIX Manager@{u}



SQL is a database query language that PHOENIX uses internally. When

you define a query with the mouse and keyboard, PHOENIX converts your

input into an SQL command, which you as a user will not notice.



However, if you are interested how a query looks as an SQL statement,

you only have to select a query in a query-list and then activate the

Edit data command (F10). The query will then appear in the system

mask, where you may even alter the SQL command.



The available SQL commands are listed in Calculation commands.

Calculates the arc cosine of a number. It is the inverse function

of COS.



@{U}Syntax:@{u}

Result = ACOS(Value);



@{B}Value@{b} is any number (a constant, Floating-point or Number field, a

variable). ACOS expects a value in the range -1..+1 and returns

the associated angle in radians.



Note that you @{I}must@{i} use a comma as the decimal separator, not a point!

@node "Alert"

@toc "Calculation commands"

@{U}A.3  Alert                                             PHOENIX Manager@{u}



This function outputs an alert box with information for the user to

the screen. The alert box can contain up to four lines of text, which

can be combined with one of four icons.

In addition an alert box can display up to five buttons. The return

will be the number of the button clicked on, where the buttons are

numbered from the left starting with 1.



@{U}Syntax:@{u}

Result=ALERT("[Icon][Text][Buttons][Pattern][Help]");



To explain the individual parameters:



@{B}Icon@{b} determines the pictogram that is to appear of the left side of

the box:

0 = @{Info ignore} icon

1 = Exclamation mark

2 = Question mark

3 = Stop sign

4 = No icon



The number must be enclosed in square brackets.



@{B}Text@{b} can be any desired text-string. Up to 4 lines @ 40 characters can

be displayed. The individual lines must be separated by a vertical

line ('|') from each other. The text must be enclosed in square

brackets.



@{B}Buttons@{b} are used to define the buttons with which the box can be quit.

A maximum of 5 buttons are possible. The button legends must again be

separated by vertical bars ('|') from each other. If the button is to

be selectable from the keyboard ([Alternate]+[Letter]) then a tilde

('~') must be inserted in front of the relevant letter.



@{B}Pattern@{b} assigns a special meaning to the buttons and can be used

optionally to produce a bell sound on opening the box.

The following order applies for this:

[Bell|No.OK-button|No.Cancel-button|No.Help-button ].



For @{B}Bell@{b} if '1' is specified then the bell will sound, with '0' it

will not.

In the other three fields you should specify which buttons are to

contain the meaning of the @{B}OK@{b}, @{B}Cancel@{b} or @{B}Help@{b} button; for this the

buttons are numbered from the left starting with 1.

If no default meaning is to be assigned, you have to specify '-1'.



@{B}Help@{b} contains a cross-reference to the entry in the Help database for

which information is to be displayed when activating the button

defined as the Help-button. (Note that this is not Help for Manager

itself, but one created for the specific database.)



If you do not specify a character here, branching to the Help database

will not take place. Since you can modify Help databases yourself (see

Appendix A in the PHOENIX manual), you can display information for the

current calculation or database with this entry.





@{I}Examples:@{i}

a)

  VAR b;

  b=ALERT("[3][Line1|Line2][Button ~1|Button ~2][0|1|1|-1][]");

b)

  VAR b;

  b=ALERT("[1][Default buttons][OK|Cancel|Help][1|1|2|3][Index]");



A click on 'Help' displays the index of the online help.

Calculates the arc sine of a number. It is the inverse function of

SIN.



@{U}Syntax:@{u}

Result=ASIN(Value);



@{B}Value@{b} is any number (a constant, Floating-point or Number field, a

variable). ASIN expects a value in the range -1..+1 and returns

the associated angle in radians.

@node "Assignment operator"

@toc "Calculation commands"

@{U}A.5  Assignment operator: =                            PHOENIX Manager@{u}



The assignment operator is the basic operation for the calculation

function. It is used to assign to the variable or field on its left-

hand side the value of the right-hand side.



For instance, the entry

@autorefoff

SUM=FIELD1+FIELD2;

has the effect that the field SUM is assigned the result of the

@autorefon

addition of the fields FIELD1 and FIELD2. During this an attempt will

be made always to convert the result to the data type of the field on

the left. So, say, if a Text field is assigned a number, then this

number will be converted to a character-string at first. If the

left-hand side of the assignment contains a variable, then it will

take the data type of the right-hand side automatically.

Calculates the arc tangent of a number. It is the inverse function of

TAN.



@{U}Syntax:@{u}

Result=ATAN(Value);



@{B}Value@{b} is any number (a constant, Floating-point or Number field, a

variable). ATAN expects any value and returns the associated angle

in radians.



Note that you @{I}must@{i} use a comma as the decimal separator, not a point!

Ascertains the average of any desired field for all data records of

the destination table that were stored with a given index.



@{U}Syntax:@{u}

Result=AVG("Fieldname;Source_index>DEST_TABLE.Dest_index");



@{B}Fieldname@{b} is the field of the DEST_TABLE for which the average is

@node "Basic arithmetic types"

@toc "Calculation commands"

@{U}A.8  Basic arithmetic types: +, -, *, /                PHOENIX Manager@{u}



The basic arithmetic types will be well known. + represents addition,

- subtraction, * multiplication and / division. These operators may

be applied to fields of the data type Number, Long and Floating-point

without restriction.



For Text fields and fields of the @{"External file" LINK "DESIGNER.HYP/Data types" 40} type, you can only

use the operator +. The addition of two character-strings corresponds

to the concatenation of the character-strings.



For Date, Time and Timestamp fields you can only apply the addition

and subtraction operators. The subtraction of two Date fields returns

the number of days between the two dates; the result can be assigned

to a field of the data type Number, Long or Floating-point.



To a Time field you can only sensibly add another Time field. The

subtraction of two time values returns a duration (time interval) in

the format HHMMSSmmmmmm (the small 'm' represents microseconds).



To a field of the type TIMESTAMP you can add Date and Time fields.

The subtraction of two TIMESTAMP values returns a time interval in

the format: DDMMYYYYHHMMSSmmmmmm (Day, Month, Year, Hours, Minutes,

Seconds, microseconds).

@{U}A.9  CHAR                                              PHOENIX Manager@{u}



Converts a value to a character-string.



@{U}Syntax:@{u}

Result=CHAR(Value);



@{B}Value@{b} is any number (a constant, Floating-point or Number field, a

variable).



@{I}Examples:@{i}

CHAR(123,45) creates the character-string '123,45'.

CHAR(51) creates the character-string '51'.

@{U}A.10  CHR                                              PHOENIX Manager@{u}



Converts a number between 0 and 255 to the associated ASCII value.



@{U}Syntax:@{u}

Result=CHR(Value);



@{B}Value@{b} is a number between 0 and 255.



@{I}Example:@{i}

CHR(65) creates the character 'A'.

CHR(13)+CHR(10) creates the (otherwise not directly inputtable)

character-string 'CR/LF' ('Carriage return/Line feed'), i.e. a line

feed.



@endnode





@node "Comparison operators"

@toc "Calculation commands"

@{U}A.11  Comparison operators: <, <=, ==, >, =>, <>       PHOENIX Manager@{u}



<  means smaller than

<= means smaller than or equal

== means equal

>  means larger than

=> means larger than or equal

<> means smaller or larger than (i.e. @{I}not@{i} equal)



These operators compare their operands with each other. The returned

result shows whether the specified condition applies (TRUE, value 1)

or not (FALSE, value 0).



@{I}Example:@{i}

Let FIELD1 and FIELD2 be of the type Number. FIELD1 contains the

value 4 and FIELD2 contain the value 9. The expression FIELD1<FIELD2

therefore returns just like the expression FIELD1<=FIELD2 the value

TRUE, while FIELD1>FIELD2 naturally returns the value FALSE.



Here it is imperative to note that for a test of equality you have

to use the operator ==, since a single equality sign is already in

use as the assignment operator!

This calculates the cosine of a number.



@{U}Syntax:@{u}

Result=COS(Value);



@{B}Value@{b} is any number (a constant, Floating-point or Number field, a

variable). COS expects a value in radians (0¯=0*pi rad, 90¯=pi/2 rad,

180¯=pi rad, 270¯=3pi/2 rad, 360¯=2pi rad etc.) as argument and

returns the associated cosine.



Note that you @{I}must@{i} use a comma as the decimal separator, not a point!

COUNT returns the number of the current data record and will be

incremented automatically during the calculation process record by

record.



@{U}Syntax and example:@{u}

This function can be used within a calculation function to 'assemble'

the name of a field from a character-string, whose contents can then

be modified further or to which a new value can be assigned.



This function can be useful when the fields of a table should have

given values preassigned to them and the names of these fields differ

from each other only by a number in the last position. If, say, your

table contains the fields FIELD1 to FIELD6 and you want to assign the

number 0 to all fields in which no value has been entered yet, then

write the following calculation:



VAR i;

i = 0;

WHILE i <= 6 DO

@{U}A.26  IF-THEN-ELSE-END                                 PHOENIX Manager@{u}



IF-THEN-ELSE-END is also called 'conditional branching' and makes it

possible to perform certain operations dependent on logical values.

Thus which part of the calculation is to be performed can depend on

a condition, for instance.



The condition should be formulated following the keyword IF. If the

condition applies, i.e. the logical expression has the value TRUE,

then the directives following the keyword THEN will be performed.

In addition further directives can follow the keyword ELSE; these

directives will be performed only if the condition following IF do

not apply, so the THEN branch is not traversed. However, the ELSE

branch can also be omitted if it is not required.



The end of an IF-THEN-ELSE structure is always flagged with the key-

word END.



Several IF-THEN-ELSE-END structures may be nested one after the other.



@{I}Example:@{i}

IF (InvoiceDate>PeriodEnd) | (InvoiceNo <=0) THEN

    IF (InvoiceAmount>500)&(ReminderProcess==0) THEN

        ReminderProcess=1;

    END;

@{U}A.65  VAR                                              PHOENIX Manager@{u}



Within a calculation it is possible to define up to 32 variables. The

variables will be treated like fields. You can assign to them values

of other fields or variables, or assign their value to other fields.

The variables have no set data type; they assume automatically the

type of the expression that is assigned to them.



The assignment 'a=3' assigns to the variable @{B}a@{b} the number @{B}3@{b}. The

variable can now be reused like a field of the type Number.



Variables have to be defined at the start of the calculation. The

keyword VAR denotes the start of a variable definition. In one line

following VAR you can declare several variables, separated by commas.

If the variable definition extends over several lines, then you have

to write VAR at the start of each line. The variable name is not case

sensitive. The first 15 characters of the variable name are used to

differentiate the variables from each other.

@{U}A.66  WHILE-DO-END                                     PHOENIX Manager@{u}



This serves for programming a loop. The assignments that follow the

keyword DO are repeated until the logical expression following WHILE

no longer has the value TRUE, but returns the value FALSE. (The

difference from REPEAT-UNTIL is that there the condition is only

checked at the end of the loop and hence the loop is always traversed

at least once; here the WHILE condition is checked immediately and

the function will be terminated as soon as it is FALSE.)



@{I}Example:@{i}



VAR counter, a;

counter=1; a=10;

WHILE counter<=10 DO

  a=a*10; counter=counter+1;

END;



The loop will be traversed ten times.

@{U}A.67  WORD                                             PHOENIX Manager@{u}



This converts any value to an integer number (in the range from -32767

to +32767, occupying 2 bytes of storage space in memory or on disk.)



@{U}Syntax:@{u}

Result=WORD(Value);



@{B}Value@{b} is any character-string or number.

This ascertains the year from a Date field.



@{U}Syntax:@{u}

@{U}B.1  Branch dialog-box                                 PHOENIX Manager@{u}

@autorefon



The source table is that table of the mask from which branching is

to take place.



The @{B}Source index@{b} listbox displays all indices of the source table

and the @{B}Destination table@{b} listbox all the tables of the database.



The @{B}Destination index@{b} listbox displays all the indices of the table

that are selected with the @{B}Destination table@{b} listbox.



The tables and indices of the 3 listboxes are sorted numerically or

alphabetically, depending on how they appear in the @{"database toolbox" LINK "Schreibtisch des Managers" "Database toolbox"}.



When you activate the @{B}OK@{b} button, at attempt is made to find the value

from the source index in the destination table via the destination

index. A new @{"mask window" LINK "Masken-Fenster"} of the destination table opens.

If the data record was found via the destination index, then Manager

will position on this data record. If the set was not found, then the

positioning will be to the data record that is closest to the destina-

tion index.



The sorting order in the created mask will be set to @{B}Ascending@{b} or

@{B}Descending@{b}, depending how it was chosen with the radio buttons in

the dialog-box.



The selections that are suggested after opening the dialog-box are

preselected according to the definition of the integrity rules. At

best all you have to do is select the @{B}OK@{b} button.



It should be a matter of course that the source and destination

indices should have the same @{"type" LINK "DESIGNER.HYP/Data types"}. You will not be able to branch

successfully if the source index is of the type Number and the

destination index is a Text!

 @{B}Old password@{b} serves as a check. You have to enter your old password

     into this field. This guarantees that no other user can change

     your password while you are temporarily not in the vicinity of

     your computer.

     The @{B}OK@{b} button is activated only after the last letter of your

     password was entered correctly.



@autorefoff

 @{B}New password@{b} is the field for inputting your new password. As soon

     as this has been input, the @{B}OK@{b} button is deactivated.



 @{B}Verification@{b} serves for checking the password. You have to input the

     new password there in exactly the same way as you did for the

     @{B}New password@{b} field (exception: case is not taken into account).

     Only when the field corresponds exactly with the @{B}New password@{b}

     field (apart from case) will the @{B}OK@{b} button become selectable

     once more.



     If nothing is entered in the fields @{B}New password@{b} and @{B}Verification@{b}

     then the password will be deleted.

@autorefon



@{I}Warning!@{i}

If you are the database administrator and forget your password, then

you can no longer access your data. However, it is possible for us to

delete your password subsequently so that you can access your data

once more. In such a case contact the hotline. You will need your

original serial number for this - pirate copies will not be supported!

This opens when you drag data records from a @{"table window" LINK "Tabellen-Fenster"} onto the

Manager's desktop.



 @{B}Clipboard name@{b} specifies the name of the new @{"table-clipboard icon" LINK "Tabellenklemmbrett-Sinnbild"}.

     The suggested default is the name of the table from which the

     data records were draggged to the desktop, though you can alter

     this if desired. Once such a clipboard icon has been created,

     further data records can be dragged to it subsequently, provided

     they originate from the same table. The usage of these icons is

 @{B}Temp directory@{b} sets the directory in which the temporary files should

     be stored. Double-clicking on the legend in front of the editable

     field opens the @{"Directory selection dialog-box" LINK "Dialogbox Verzeichnisauswahl"}.

     Alternatively you can type the full path of the desired directory

     into the field, clearing it first if necessary by pressing the

     [Esc] key. If you leave the field empty, then a search will be

     made for the environmental variables 'TEMP' or 'TMP' and the path

     given there will be used.



 @{B}Blink rate@{b} specifies how often a popup menu or a command of a window

     menu should blink before the command is executed. If the value

     is 0, then no blinking takes place.



 @{B}Tab size@{b} sets the number of spaces to which a Tab character will be

     expanded when text is inserted from an external clipboard.





 ˘ In the @{B}System parameters@{b} area, the checkboxes have the following

   effects when switched on:



 @{B}Sound bell on errors@{b} sounds an accoustic signal as well as showing

     an error message each time an error occurs.



 @{B}Sound bell at process end@{b} sounds an accoustic signal after the

     regular termination of a process.



 @{B}Draw grow/shrinkboxes@{b} draws expanding and shrinking rectangles while

     windows are opened and closed.



 @{B}@{Save ignore} automatically@{b} saves Manager's configuration before the program

     is quit. This corresponds to the manual operation of the command

     Save configuration in the Parameters menu.



 @{B}Use external fonts@{b} will load further fonts when the @{B}OK@{b} button is

     activated, provided an NVDI is installed on the system.



 @{B}Hide function keys@{b} removes the function key bar from the Manager's

     desktop; you then have more space for windows.



 @{B}Hide icon bar@{b} removes the icon bar from the desktop, giving you more

     space for the windows.



 @{B}Number of records for query@{b} makes an info-box appear after each query

     which shows how many data records the query applies to. However

     this happens only if the query finds a partial set of all the

     table's data records. If only columns are hidden, then the result

     of a query appears immediately.



 @{B}Use calculation@{b} performs the currently assigned calculation before

     each action automatically (e.g. when displaying a table). This

     makes a 'what-would-happen-if' calculation possible.



@autorefoff

 @{B}Start processes iconified@{b} displays all processes immediately as

     icons instead of in a window.



 @{B}Start processes always exclusive@{b} starts all processes immediately

     in exclusive mode. If a process is started exclusively, then

     @{B}Start processes iconified@{b} has no effect.

@autorefon



 @{B}Warning on empty tables@{b} outputs a warning message before processing

     an empty table.





 ˘ In the @{B}Table parameters@{b} area, the checkboxes have the following

   effects when switched on:



 @{B}Grid lines@{b} draws a net of grid lines between the lines and columns

     of table windows.



 @{B}@{Info ignore} line visible@{b} displays the info line with the current sorting

     direction in table windows.



 @{B}Top line visible@{b} displays the top line with the column names in

     table windows.



 @{B}Left column visible@{b} displays an additional left column with the

     current number of each line in table windows.



 @{B}Fill pattern in header@{b} will place a pattern behind the top (column

     name) line and the left (numbering) column on 2-colour (mono)

     screens which distinguish the line and column from the actual

     data (in 16-colour resolutions and up these will have a grey

     background in any case).





 ˘ In the @{B}Cache parameters@{b} area:



 @{B}Max. index cache@{b} specifies the maximum amount of index cache that is

     to be preset on opening a database. If the value is left empty,

     then the file size will be assumed.



 @{B}Max. data cache@{b} specifies the maximum amount of data cache that is

     to be preset on opening a database. If the value is left empty,

     then the file size will be assumed.



 @{I}Note:@{i}

 If your computer only has a modest amount of memory (RAM) and you

 have to frequently handle large databases, then it is recommended

 that you restrict the caches (say to 500 KB each).

     then the database should be @{"reorganised" LINK "Reorganisation"}.



 @{B}Autoflush@{b}, when showing @{B}Yes@{b}, means that the index and/or data files

     are written immediately. @{B}No@{b} means that they are held in memory

     and only written later. (Once the database is open this can not

     You can climb back up the directory tree by clicking on one of

     the lighter downward-pointing triangles.



 @{B}Drives@{b} shows the connected drives/partitions in a drop-down listbox.

     If a new drive is selected, then the corresponding directories

     of this drive will be displayed in the list for selection.



 @{B}Sort by@{b} shows the current sorting criterium for the display of the

     directories in a listbox. The @{B}Length@{b} item has no effect on the

    specify other files (the latter changes to the A:\ directory).

    The selected file is activated by operation of the @{B}OK@{b} button.



 The scrolable list directly below shows the files in the current

    directory that match the extension in the @{B}File formats@{b} listbox.

    You can select a file in the list either with a mouse click or

    by using the arrow keys. It will then appear under @{B}Filename@{b}.



 @{B}File formats@{b} shows what types of file the Manager can handle for

     the action you are about to perform. If you choose a new format

     then only files matching the new file suffix will be displayed

     in the list above.



 @{B}Directories@{b} shows the currently set directory, with the scrolable

 ˘ The @{B}Separator characters@{b} area allows you to set the characters to

   be used for delimiting data records and fields when the data

   records are output in ASCII format.



 @{B}Record@{b} sets the separation characters that are written after each

     data record during @{"export" LINK "Export"}. These are specified in decimals from

     the ASCII table; 13 corresponds to a carriage return (CR), 10 to

     a linefeed (LF). The individual characters are separated by a

     comma. You can also specify character-strings if these are

     enclosed in quote-marks; it does not matter whether these are

     single ('xxxx') or double ("xxxx") quotes.



 @{B}Field@{b} sets the separation characters that are written after each

     field during export. These are specified in decimals from the

     ASCII table; 13 corresponds to a carriage return (CR), 10 to a

     linefeed (LF). The individual characters are separated by a

     comma. You can also specify character-strings if these are

     enclosed in quote-marks; it does not matter whether these are

     single ('xxxx' or double ("xxxx") quotes.



 @{B}Text@{b} specifies whether and through which characters Text fields can

     be enclosed. Some databases require such characters.

     So if for instance each Text field should be enclosed in double

     quotes, then you should enter the value '"' or 34 in this field.





 ˘ In the @{B}Conversion area:



 @{B}Export@{b} offers an option to set a given character coding, specially

     for accented/umlaut characters that often have different coding

     on various computer systems. But to use this, you have to install

     KEYTAB by Martin ElsÑsser on your Atari!





 ˘ In the @{B}Format@{b} area you have various formats available that are to

   be paid regard to during @{"importing" LINK "Import"} and @{"exporting" LINK "Export"}.



 With @{B}Binary@{b} selected, the data records can be exported in binary

     format. This is the shortest and quickest format, and is particu-

     larly useful if graphics or sound fields exist in a table.



 With @{B}ASCII@{b} selected, the data records can be exported in ASCII

     format. This is a pure text format and is particularly suitable

     for data exchange with other programs.



 With @{B}Column names@{b} switched on, an additional header is written

     before the first data record that specifies the field names.

     This will be required if data are to be processed further with

     the circular letter function of a text processor (e.g. Signum!4).



 @{B}Decimal point@{b} sets the format of the decimal divider. It is used

     when @{"exporting" LINK "Export"} decimal numbers and may not be left empty.





 ˘ In the @{B}Dates@{b} area you can choose in which format Date fields are

   imported and exported:



 If @{B}DD.MM.YYYY@{b}, @{B}MM.DD.YY@{b} or @{B}YYYY.MM.DD@{b} is selected, then the Date

     fields can be exported or imported in the corresponding format.



 If @{B}Days since 01.01.1900@{b} is selected, then the Date fields will be

     exported or imported as numbers, which specify the number of days

     since 01.01.1900. Some spreadsheets programs require this format.





 ˘ In the @{B}@{Import ignore} mode@{b} area you can decide how data records are to be

   imported:



 If @{B}Insert@{b} is selected then during @{"import" LINK "Import"} each read data record will

     be inserted anew.



 If @{B}Replace@{b} is selected then during import each read data record will

     be either inserted or modified. It will be inserted if it is not

     yet present in the database, else modified if it is already in

     the database. The Manager recognises this from the primary key

     of the read-in data record matching that of a data record that's

     already present in the table.



 @{B}Load...@{b} serves for loading the import/export parameters from a text

     file previously saved with:

@{U}B.14  Index info dialog-box                            PHOENIX Manager@{u}

@autorefon



This dialog-box displays all information about the current index, as

it was defined in @{Designer ignore}, with some further information.



 @{B}Table@{b} is the name of the table for which the information is provided.



 @{B}Name@{b} shows the name of the index, which was defined in @{Designer ignore}.

     It is either the name of the column from which the index origi-

     nated, or the name that was defined for a multi-index.



 @{B}Index@{b} shows the columns from which an index is composed. The field

     contains either the same entry as the @{B}Name@{b} field, or is composed

     of several column names.

     The first case applies whenever a single column was chosen as an

     index. The second case applies for a multi-index.



 @{B}Type@{b} shows the type of index. It is either the same as the type of

     the column from which the index originated, or 'TEXT' when it is

     composed from several columns.

     An exception is a multi-Index composed from two numbers; this

     becomes a Long.



 @{B}Root@{b} specifies the starting block in the index tree. This value is

     0 if no keys have been entered for the index yet.



 @{B}Keys@{b} shows the number of keys in an index. This number must match

     the number of data records in the @{"Table info dialog-box" LINK "Dialogbox Tabellen-Info"}. If this

     is not the case, then some data records can not be accessed via

     this index. This can happen, say, if the computer crashed at some

     time before all index keys were written. In such cases you should

     @{"reorganise" LINK "Reorganisation"} the database.





 ˘ The @{B}Attributes@{b} area shows whether the index contains a @{B}Primary@{b},

   @{B}Unique@{b} or @{B}Other@{b} keys.

## Addiert

 ˘ In the @{B}General@{b} area the checkboxes have the following effect when

   switched on:



 @{B}Clear fields after insertion@{b} automatically clears the mask after the

     insertion of each data record into the table. This can be a dis-

     advantage, say, if you want to acquire several data records with

     similar contents; in that case it is better to switch this off.



 @{B}Automatic fileselector@{b} opens the fileselector-box each time you

     place the cursor on an empty field of the @{"External file" LINK "DESIGNER.HYP/Data types" 40}, @{"BLOB" LINK "DESIGNER.HYP/Data types" 72}

     or Graphic type.



 @{B}Position in listbox@{b} means that with the @{B}Show popup@{b} command a search

     will be made in the listbox for the contents of the field in

     which the cursor is positioned and the corresponding data record

     preselected there. With listboxes containing several thousand

     data records this may take some time, however. If this checkbox

     is switched off, then the first data record will be preselected

     in the listbox.



 @{B}Confirm deletions@{b} will display a warning message before a record is

     deleted with @{"Delete" LINK "Delete (record)"} in the mask menu.



 @{B}Play on display@{b} replays fields that contain sound samples each time

     the mask is redrawn. With the checkbox switched off this has to

     be done manually by placing the cursor over a Sound field and

     activating the @{B}Display field@{b} command.



 The @{B}Volume@{b} editable field lets you set the loudness of replayed

     Sound samples between 0 and 128, where 0 is the quietest and

     128 the loudest value.

 @{B}Database@{b} displays the database that was selected earlier with the

     fileselector-box.



 @{B}User@{b} must be filled out if this database was protected by the data-

     base administrator. This can be done in the @{Designer ignore} program.

     The database administrator must then have assigned a user name

     to you under which you can modify the database.



 @{B}Password@{b} must be filled out when you were entered as a user by the

     database administrator and then created a password for yourself

     at sime time. The creation or changing of the password is done

     with the command Change password.





 ˘ In the @{B}Cache area@{b} you can make settings affecting the caches:



 @{B}Index cache@{b} allows you to enter the amount of memory (in KB) that

     is to be reserved for the index file.



 @{B}Data cache@{b} allows you to enter the amount of memory (in KB) that

     is to be reserved for the data file.



 @{B}Write index@{b} checkbox must be switched on if the index file is to be

     updated immediately at each write process, i.e. saved to a floppy

     or hard disk. If this is switched off then the index file will

     be updated only on closing the database. Alternatively to this

     the command @{B}Write cache@{b} in the Options menu will update the

     index file 'by hand'.



 @{B}Write data@{b} checkbox must be switched on if the data file is to be

     updated immediately at each write process, i.e. saved to a floppy

     or hard disk. If this is switched off then the data file will

     be updated only on closing the database. Alternatively to this

     the command @{B}Write cache@{b} will update the data file 'by hand'.

     If this switch is turned off and the computer crashes, then any

     changes made since the last Save will be lost.



     @{I}Note:@{i}

     In multi-user or multi-tasking operation the index and data files

     are always updated continuously, so that these two switches have

     no effect.





 ˘ In the @{B}Mode@{b} area, selection buttons determine in which operational

     mode the database is to be opened. Selecting the radio button:



 @{B}Single user (exclusive)@{b} means that you can use the database only if

     you are the only user at the time. This is the mode in which you

     will normally use the database.



 @{B}Multi-tasking@{b} means that you can call up the database on a computer

     running a multitasking operating system together with several

     other applications running simultaneously. This slows down the

     speed of operation.



 @{B}Multi-user@{b} means that you can use the database together with other

     users in a networked environment.

     A prerequisite for this is that no other user has logged into the

     database exclusively. In addition the operating system must be

     capable of being able to handle files from several processes at

     the same time as well as being able to lock a file. If the latter

     is not the case, a corresponding warning message will be output

     on opening the database.



 The @{B}Read-only@{b} checkbox must be switched on if the database should

     only be read, not written to. This may be necessary if the data-

     base lies on a write-protected medium, a CD-ROM, or has a table

     of contents which may not be written to by a given user.

     Once it is opened, such a database can not be modified.

 ˘ The @{B}Header/Footer@{b} area contains the header and footer lines for a

 @{B}Header@{b} These three fields set the header lines. They can contain

     any text. It is possible also to enter predefined variables,

     such as the current page number, for instance (see below).



 @{B}Footer@{b} These three fields set the footer lines. The same applies as

     for the header lines.

     The icons can be clicked on and produce variables that are then

     editable fields. The variables and their meanings are listed

     below and correspond to the icons left to right:



          @{I}Variable  Meaning @{i}

@Line 11 47 0 0 1

          $B        Database name

          $S        Sorting (table and the current index)

          $P        Page number

          $D        Date (the current date)

          $T        Time (the current time)





 ˘ The @{B}Paper@{b} area contains information about the current width

   and length of a page.



 @{B}Width@{b} sets the width of a page in characters.



 @{B}Length@{b} sets the length of a page in lines.



 @{B}Top marg@{b} sets the number of lines to be left free at the top of the

     page.



 @{B}Bottom marg@{b} sets the number of lines to be left free at the bottom

     of the page.



 @{B}Header marg@{b} sets the number of lines in the header area. If this

     field is set to 0 then no header will be output even if a header

     has been defined.



 @{B}Footer marg@{b} sets the number of lines in the footer area. If this

     field is set to 0 then no footer will be output even if a footer

     has been defined.



 @{B}Lines/page@{b} shows the resulting number of lines actually available

     with the above settings, i.e. the length of the page less all

     margins and any column header that may be present. It is equal

     to the number of data records that will fit on one page.



 @{B}Left marg@{b} sets the number of characters to be left free as the left

     edge of the page.





 ˘ The @{B}Switches@{b} area offers some options that are paid regard to when

   outputting to a table. However they apply only to outputs to disk

   or printer.



 If @{B}Formfeed@{b} is switched on, then a formfeed will be created after

     the output of each table to the printer.



 If @{B}Column headers@{b} is switched on, then on outputting a table to disk

     or printer each new page will be prefaced by a header containing

     the column names; this is followed by a line with separation

     dashes.



 If @{B}Summing@{b} is switched on, then a total sum of all numeric fields in

     the list will be output at the end of the table. If additionally

     a value is entered into the @{B}Group@{b} field, then intermediate sums

     will be output as well.



 @{B}Group@{b} sets the number of places paid regard to for group division.

     You can also regard this number as a sort of 'sensitivity'. The

     larger it is the more places will be paid regard to in the group

     division. This group division relates to the current index key

     by which the table is sorted for output. All data records whose

     first 'x' positions match belong to the same group. Here 'x' is

     the number that was entered in the @{B}Group@{b} field. Each group is

     separated from the next one by an empty line.



     @{I}Note:@{i}

     If @{U}Summing@{u} is switched on as well, then a subtotal of all numeric

     values wil be output after each group. At the end of the complete

     list a total will be output as well.



 @{B}Load...@{b} serves for loading page formats from a previously saved

     text file. The parameters loaded will then be displayed in the

     dialog-box.



 @{B}@{Save ignore}...@{b} serves for saving the parameters displayed in this dialog-box

     to a text file, where they are available for reuse.

@autorefon



The printer icon shows the currently loaded printer driver. Clicking

on this icon allows you to load a new driver (with a .PRT extension).



Please take note that the settings made here apply only for direct

printouts, not for the graphical printouts of the report via NVDI.



 @{B}Control chars@{b} allows you to input additional control characters to be

     sent to the printer before printing starts. These may be control

     characters to place the printer in a defined state. The control

     characters should be explained in the manual for the relevant

     printer. The format corresponds to the @{B}Record@{b} field in the

     @{"Im/Export parameters dialog-box" LINK "Dialogbox Im/Export-Parameter"}.



 @{B}Output files@{b} must have the editable field completed if output is to

     be 'printed' to a file rather than a printer. You can type in the

     full path directly, but it is more convenient to double-click on

     the legend in front of the editable field to open a fileselector

     where you can set the desired path and filename. For this to work

     the @{B}File@{b} radio button has to be switched on in the @{B}Output device@{b}

     area.





 ˘ The @{B}@{Font ignore}@{b} area lets you select various fonts and attributes that

     are available for printout:



     @{B}Pica@{b} or @{B}Elite@{b} specify the matching font. With Pica you generally

     have 10 characters per inch printed, so that on a DIN A4 page 80

     characters will fit in a line across the paper (without margins).

     With Elite this is 12 characters per inch, so that 96 characters

     will fit in a line.

     @{B}Narrow@{b}, @{B}Small@{b}, @{B}Wide@{b}, @{B}Italic@{b}, @{B}Bold@{b} and @{B}NLQ@{b} checkboxes modify the

     font set by the radio buttons. Their availability depends on the

     printer driver being used.





 ˘ @{B}Output device@{b} specifies the port to be used for output:



 If @{B}Spooler@{b} is switched on then the incorporated spooler will be used.

     During printing output will be to a temporary file at first and

     then passed on by the Spooler to the printer in the background.

     This can be an advantage since output to a file is faster than

     to a fairly slow printer. However, this requires external storage

     space in which the temporary file is created; after printing this

     will be deleted again. The Spooler is not active if the @{B}File @{b}

     radio button is switched on as well.



 If @{B}File@{b} is selected, then output will not be to a printer but to a

     file, which can be specified in the @{B}Output files@{b} editable field.



 With the @{B}PRN@{b} radio button selected, output will be to the printer

     that is connected to the parallel port of the computer.

     If @{B}Spooler@{b} is activated as well, output will be first to a

     temporary file, then in the backround to the printer.



 With the @{B}AUX@{b} radio button selected, output will be to the printer

     that is connected to the serial port of the computer.

     If @{B}Spooler@{b} is activated as well, output will be first to a

     temporary file, then in the backround to the printer.





 ˘ In the @{B}Line spacing@{b} area you can set the spacing with which the

     lines of a table or a template are output:



 With @{B}1/6@{b} selected the separation will be 1/6 inch. With this up to

     70 lines will fit on a DIN A4 page (without margins; in practice

     this will be a maximum of 66 printable lines).

## Die Anzahl im Original war falsch - 72 Zeilen passen nur auf 12 Zoll

## Endlospapier! Mit einzelnen Blaettern muss der Drucker sie auch halten!

## Auch stand dort 'mit Seitenrand' was nicht stimmt!



 With @{B}1/8@{b} selected the separation will be 1/8 inch. With this up to

     92 lines will fit on a DIN A4 page (without margins; in practice

     this will be a maximum of 88 printable lines).

## Wie oben





 ˘ In the @{B}Spooler parameters@{b} area you can decide how fast the Spooler

     is to operate. As a printer is a slow device, there may be times

     when the computer outputs a character but the printer can not

     handle the character quickly enough. As a result the program is

     halted and has to wait for the printer. On the other hand, if the

     program does not output the characters fast enough to the printer

     then this is not working at full capacity. The consequence: The

     printer prints a line now and again and rests inbetween.



 The @{B}Events/sec@{b} editable field lets you set the number of events that

     the next Spooler process to start is to receive. Sensible values

     lie between 1 and 100. It specifies the number of passes that a

     process can make per second.



 @{B}Bytes/event@{b} lets you set the number of bytes that the Spooler process

     can send to the printer per event. Sensible values lie between 1

     and 1000. Depending on the number of events to be handled per

     second, this value may have to be modified.



     @{I}Note:@{i}

     If the printer balks during printing, increase the number of

     @{B}Events@{b} or @{B}Bytes@{b}; if the printer slows down the operation of

     the program, decrease the values.





 The @{B}Driver...@{b} button serves for loading a new printer driver, just

     like a click on the printer icon at top left.



 The @{B}Load...@{b} button is used for loading new printer parameters from

     a previously saved text file, opening a fileselector-box to let

     you choose a suitable file.



 The @{B}@{Save ignore}...@{b} button serves for saving the parameters displayed in

     this dialog-box to a text file. Note that this does not include

     the printer driver.

error (@{B}Line@{b} and @{B}Column@{b}) and selecting the @{B}Edit@{b} button places the edit

cursor at the error making it easy to make changes.

@{U}B.32  Search dialog-box                                PHOENIX Manager@{u}

@autorefon



The top three lines show the @{B}Database@{b}, @{B}Table@{b} and @{B}Index@{b} used for the

search.



 In the @{B}Term@{b} editable field you type in the term you wish to find;

     for tables it refers to the index used in the table.

     It is possible also to search for a given data record by its

     position instead of a term. For this the field has to be prefixed

     with the '#' character:



     @{I}Term     Meaning@{i}

@Line 6 39 0 0 1

     Joppich  @{Search ignore} for term 'Joppich'

     #1000    Jump to position 1000

     #+250    Jump 250 data records forward

     #-300    Jump 300 data records backward

@symbol "Full text search"



 With @{B}Full text search@{b} active, the search will be made through all

     fields without using the current index; such a search without

     an index takes appreciably more time.



     If you are not sure of the complete term to be searched for, nor

     know at which position of the field the term you are looking for

     lies, the use of the wildcards '?' for any one character and '*'

     for any number of arbitrary characters recommends itself. Thus

     to find 'Meier' for certain, no matter how it is spelt and in

     what position in a field the name was input, you should use

     '*M??er*' for the search term.



 @{B}Respect upper/lowercase@{b} is only available for @{B}Full text search@{b} and

     when active differentiates between capitals and lower case.



 @{B}Forwards@{b} looks for data records that are displayed after the present

     position in the window.



 @{B}Backwards@{b} looks for data records that are displayed earlier than the

     present position in the window.

@{U}B.33  Sorting dialog-box                               PHOENIX Manager@{u}



The top two lines show the @{B}Database@{b} and @{B}Table@{b} that sorting is to be

performed on.



 The @{B}Fields@{b} listbox displays all fields of the table. One field at

     a time in it can be clicked on and then a click on the @{B}>>>>>@{b}

     button transfers it to the @{B}Sort by@{b} box. For this the setting of

     the @{B}Sort@{b} radio buttons is respected.

     The same result can be achieved by a double-click on the listbox

     field. After the field is transferred it vanishes from the @{B}Fields@{b}

     listbox.



 The @{B}Sort by@{b} listbox shows those fields that have been transferred

     already from the @{B}Fields@{b} list. Additionally the sort direction to

     be used is shown, @{B}+@{b} meaning ascending and @{B}-@{b} descending order.



 A click on @{B}>>>>>@{b} transfers the next field from the @{B}Fields@{b} box to the

     @{B}Sort by@{b} box.



 A click on @{B}<<<<<@{b} transfers the last field from the @{B}Sort by@{b} box back

     to the @{B}Fields@{b} box.



 In the @{B}Sort@{b} area you can choose whether the next field to be trans-

     ferred to the @{B}Sort by@{b} box should use an @{B}Ascending@{b} or @{B}Descending@{b}

     sorting order. A double-click on one of the two buttons or its

     legend has the effect of transferring the currently selected

     field in the @{B}Fields@{b} box; naturally the corresponding sorting

     direction will be switched to beforehand.



 The @{B}@{New ignore}@{b} button clears the complete @{B}Sort by@{b} list and gives you the

     chance to start again.

@toc "The dialog-boxes"

@{U}B.35  User interface dialog-box                        PHOENIX Manager@{u}



This appears when you select the @{B}User desktop@{b} entry in the main

Parameters menu.



 ˘ The @{B}Colours@{b} area lets you assign a colour to elements of the user

     interface desktop.



 @{B}Element@{b} shows the element whose colour is to be altered. You can

     select the element to be affected from the drop-down list.



 @{B}Colour@{b} offers a selection of up to 16 different colours for the

     element. Selection is only sensible providing the current screen

     resolution can display at least 16 colours.





 ˘ The @{B}Display@{b} area offers the possibility of determining the basic

     appearance of the user interface.



 If @{B}3D-look desktop@{b} is switched on (checkbox crossed) then the user

     interface will be drawn in a modern three-dimensional style.

     However this requires a screen resolution that is capable of

     displaying at least 16 colours.



 If @{B}Dialogs with frames@{b} is switched on, then the dialog-boxes will be

     provided with a 'picture frame'. This function too needs a screen

     resolution capable of displaying at least 16 colours.



 If @{B}Use standard fileselector@{b} is switched on, then the fileselector

     installed on the system will be used. With the checkbox uncrossed

     @{"PHOENIX's own fileselector" LINK "Dialogbox Dateiauswahl"} will be employed instead.





 ˘ The @{B}Control elements@{b} area gives the option of assigning various

     icon symbols to some elements of the user interface.



 @{B}Checkbox@{b} offers a selection of symbols to denote a chekbox.



 @{B}Radio button@{b} lets you choose a symbol to denote a radio button.



 @{B}Arrows@{b} lets you choose the appearance of arrows in listboxes and

     popup listboxes.





 ˘ The @{B}Desktop@{b} area offers options for changing the appearance of

     the desktop surface.



 @{B}Colour@{b} permits the selection of up to 16 different colours for the

     desktop background, provided you are working with a 16-colour or

     higher screen resolution. If the colour @{B}White@{b} is selected then

     you can not choose a fill-pattern (all would be white on white).



 @{B}Fill@{b} offers a selection of 8 different fill-patterns for the desktop

     background (but see above).



 If the @{B}Display in window@{b} checkbox is switched on (crossed), the

     Manager desktop will be placed in a plain window the next time

     you launch the program.



 Switching on @{B}Activate with click@{b} as well allows you to return to the

     Manager's desktop quickly from a database or a mask window by

     just clicking on it. Furthermore the desktop will be the topped

     window the next time you launch the program.



 By activating @{B}Display scroll bars@{b} as well as @{B}Display in window@{b}, the

     window will have the normal horizontal and vertical scroll bars

     at its bottom and right edge at the next program launch.





 ˘ The @{B}Buttons@{b} area lets you change the appearance of the large

     buttons in dialog-boxes (e.g. @{B}OK@{b}, @{B}Cancel@{b}, @{B}Help@{b} etc.).



 @{B}Rounded corners@{b} will be drawn for the buttons when the checkbox is

     crossed.



 @{B}Shadow width@{b} lets you add shadows of adjustable width by activating

     the checkbox and typing the desired width in the editable field;

     the larger the value the more the buttons seem to protrude from

     the screen plane. Note that this function is available only in

     16-colour resolutions and up and also only if @{B}3D-look desktop@{b}

     is active.





 ˘ The @{B}Standard@{b} button restores the appearance of all the elements

     to the default for the system.

@{U}E  PHOENIX and OLGA                                    PHOENIX Manager@{u}



@{B}Introduction to OLGA@{b}



With OLGA ('@{B}O@{b}bject @{B}L@{b}inking for @{B}G@{b}EM @{B}A@{b}pplications') a new concept comes

into use under MagiC or other multitasking operating systems, just

like those that came into fashion on other computer platforms at the

time. Think of OLE from Microsoft or OpenDoc from Apple.



OLGA is a system extension for MagiC, MultiTOS, N.AES etc. that

permits the programs supporting it to access data objects jointly.



Here is apractical example of the advantages that OLGA offers:

Let us assume that you import a graphic into a graphics field in

Manager. Now you realise that the image has to be altered. Since

the Manager itself does not offer any drawing functions, you had

to do the following until now:

1. Export the graphic again.

2. Launch Pixart4 (for example - or any suitable graphics program,

   which can be specified in the OLGA.INF file).

3. Load graphic into Pixart4 and modify it.

4. @{Save ignore} the graphic and quit Pixart4.

5. Reimport the graphic into the data record.



This is far more elegant via OLGA. You first import the graphic into

Manager. A double-click on this graphic starts Pixart4 automatically

in parallel to Manager and the graphic can be modified immediately.

When saving the changes in Pixart4 the graphic in the input mask of

the Manager is updated automatically, without any actions being

necessary.



Or you type a long text into a mask. Now you want to make extensive

changes to this text, which would be quite a burden with Manager's

own, limited, editor. Just double-click on the Text field in the mask

and OLGA looks after the launch of the QED text editor (or similar -

again you can choose in OLGA.INF) in parallel and opens a window with

this text. You can now modify the text, and after saving it you will

now find the changes in the input mask immediately without having to

perform any further actions.



The OLGA protocol is executed by the parallel-launched and otherwise

invisible OLGA-Manager (OLGA.APP), which during the installation of

PHOENIX is installed in MagiC's @{Start ignore} folder on request (by default

in C:\GEMSYS\MAGIC\START).



OLGA is supported at present by PHOENIX, CAB, Texel, ArtWorx, Pixart4

and the editors Everest and QED, amongst others. Further programs will

follow.



@{B}OLGA in @{Designer ignore}@{b}



During the creation of input masks in @{"Designer" LINK "DESIGNER.HYP/Maskenfenster"} it is possible to

accommodate graphic objects in the masks. Thanks to OLGA it is simple

to make changes to these graphic objects. You just have to double-

click on the graphic. The @{B}Image size@{b} dialog-box appears; activating

the @{B}Edit@{b} button launches the OLGA-Server installed for the graphic

type (Pixart4 for bitmap images, ArtWorx for metafiles for instance)

in parallel to @{Designer ignore} and opens the graphic there for any modifi-

cations you wish to make. Once you have made them, save the graphic

again. The mask will be updated immediately in @{Designer ignore}.



@{B}OLGA in Manager@{b}



In Manager too the OLGA support is applied to the input mask. Here

various actions are possible.



With a double-click on a Text field the OLGA-Server for texts (QED by

default - can be changed in OLGA.INF) is launched and this text is

opened in it for modification. On saving the modified text in QED the

changes become visible immediately in Manager's input mask and the

data record will be marked as changed. With Change in the Record menu

of the Masks window menu-bar the changes will be saved to the

database.



A double-click on a graphic field will launch the OLGA-Server suitable

for the graphic format (Pixart4 for GEM images [.IMG] or ArtWorx for

metafiles [.GEM] for instance) in parallel to Manager and opens the

graphic there for any modifications you wish to make. Here too the

changes you have made become visible in the input mask as soon as you

have saved the graphic.



The functions listed above can be applied to @{"External file" LINK "DESIGNER.HYP/Data types" 40} type

fields as well. For this you should first double-click on the field

with the filename. The file will be displayed in a window. A double-

click on the window's contents transfers the file for modification

into the relevant OLGA-Server.

The @{Designer ignore} in the database system PHOENIX has the following tasks:



   ˘ Creation of new databases

   ˘ Modification of existing databases

   ˘ Backup functions for the entire database structure (@{Export ignore},

     @{Import ignore})

   ˘ Printing the database structure for documentation purposes

     in a graphic format (only with NVDI!)

   ˘ Creation of any number of masks for a database

   ˘ Assignment of user and access rights

   ˘ Creation of a text description and C-interface of the database

     structure

@{U}G.2  About PHOENIX                                     PHOENIX Manager@{u}



The database PHOENIX consists of a network-capable database kernel

that can handle all kinds of data (including colour graphics and

sound) of any size. This kernel was adapted specially for requirements

of graphical user interfaces such as GEM and Windows. This enables

super-fast scrolling and display in windows.



Here are some of its performance data:



   ˘ Number of records per database: 2 billion

   ˘ Size per data record: 2 Gigabyte

   ˘ Size of a field per data record: 100 Megabyte

   ˘ Number of tables per database: 32767

   ˘ Number of fields per database: 32767

   ˘ Maximum filesize: 2 Gigabyte = 2048 Megabyte

   ˘ Number of data types per field: 11

   ˘ Index caching for very fast scrolling and searching

   ˘ Data caching for very fast window output

   ˘ Guarantee of referential integrity by the kernel

   ˘ Access protection to database, table and field planes

   ˘ Permanently available context-sensitive help system

   ˘ Freely available graphical formation of masks

   ˘ Number of simultaneously open databases: 8

   ˘ Number of parallel-running processes: 6

   ˘ Query by example

   ˘ Number of clipboards on the desktop: 18

   ˘ Minimum memory requirement: 1.5 MB

   ˘ Runs on ATARIs, Macs with MagiC Mac and PCs with MagiC PC in all

     screen resolutions and with all graphic cards.



The modules DESIGNER and MANAGER are based on the above-mentioned

kernel. DESIGNER is used to lay out the masks common to the whole

database (the equivalent of the labels for the data fields, and their

size and position in a card index - see About Designer).



MANAGER serves for the entry of the actual data for the database, its

evaluation and output of the database contents in a graphical format

(see About Manager).



You can write your own database programs with the aid of a

C-interface (PHOENIX/Base for PureC).

@toc "Known errors in PHOENIX"

@{U}H.1  Incorrect memory display                          PHOENIX Manager@{u}



@{B}Has anyone noticed the PHOENIX has problems with TT-Ram >16 Mb? With

me the display has:



TOS 3.06

MEM: -32575k, TOT: -29199k



MiNT/N.AES

MEM: 32547k, TOT: -29559k@{b}



This is obviously completely wrong. It appears that there are still

faulty parts from SCRAP in this that were not corrected - a pretty

dumb error.



The explanation for this is that the resource (built into PHOENIX)

specifies an erroneous formatting string for sprintf. I have found

this in the Scrap project in the book from brothers Geiss.



It looks like this: 'MEM: %4d KB', but should be 'MEM: %4u KB'.



The memory size is specified in KB as a @{WORD ignore}, i.e. %4d results in a

number >32767 outputting a negative value; therefore there should be

%4u there. I have changed this in Scrap and then it worked, so it

should be a simple patch in PHOENIX that could be done without major

problems.



One could change this with a HEX editor or QED in binary mode. One

has to careful not to change the length of the character-string.

@toc "Known errors in PHOENIX"

@{U}H.2  Auto-load a DB with password                      PHOENIX Manager@{u}



@{B}There is still the error with the automatic loading of a DB with pass-

word in @{Designer ignore}. This results in a bad crash, partly only solvable

by a reset or switching the computer off and on again.@{b}



The reason is that the stack is too small for the many subprograms

nested within each other. Data is overwritten.



One can correct this - just patch the program header, i.e. enlarge

the BSS region.

@{B}If one creates a new report and @{I}no report has been saved as yet,@{i} an

error arises when creating a Sub-report. Drawing out a frame for the

@node "Black operational elements"

@toc "Known errors in PHOENIX"

@{U}H.4  Black operational elements                        PHOENIX Manager@{u}



If the PHOENIX operational elements look a little peculiar, it can

help to set the AdaptBitmaps entry in the @{"SYSTEM.INF file" link "The SYSTEM.INF file"}.



@endnode





@node "The SYSTEM.INF file"

@toc "Inhalt"

@{U}I  The SYSTEM.INF file                                 PHOENIX Manager@{u}



In the PHOENIX directory there is the folder SYSTEM which contains

the file SYSTEM.INF. This file contains information that Manager and

@{Designer ignore} can use for configuration of their user interface. So that

PHOENIX can access the file, you must copy the SYSTEM folder to a

GEMSYS folder on drive C.



Here follows a sample SYSTEM.INF file with an explanation of the

components (lines starting with a ';' are comments/explanations):



[Drives]

;<drive letter>=<descriptor>

;<descriptors are>:

;FD=Floppy disk drive

;HD=Hard disk drive

;CD=CD-ROM drive

;NET=Network mapped drive

;RD=RAM drive

;FDs and HDs are recognized by system and are therefore optional

A=FD

B=FD

C=HD

D=HD

E=HD

F=HD

G=NET

Y=CD

Z=RD



[IconMappings]

;<suffixes>=<img file without suffix>

APP;PRG;AC?;TOS;TTP=app

BIN=bin

GEM=gem

IMG=img

IND;DAT=ind

INF=inf

PRT;PRN=prt

TXT;ASC;C;DBS;DOC;H;ICO;LST;RPT=txt



[System]

AdaptBitmaps=1

GetVolumeNames=0

GDOSmaxDevice=40



Under @{B}[Drives]@{b} one can specify the types of the individual drives

more precisely. The new PHOENIX fileselector-box uses the information

stored here for displaying a suitable icon before each drive name. It

distinguishes between floppy drives (FD), hard disk (HD), CD-ROM (CD),

network drivwes (NET) and RAM-disks (RD). The assignment of floppy and

hard disk drives does not have to be made manually, since these are

recognised automatically by the system.

The syntax of the assignment is: @{B}Drive-ID=Drive type@{b}



@{B}[IconMappings]@{b} controls the allocation of file icons to the filetypes

used by the PHOENIX fileselector-box for display. Built into PHOENIX

are icons for the filetypes @{B}APP, PRG, ACC, TOS, TTP@{b} (descriptor @{B}app@{b}),

@{B}BIN@{b} (descriptor @{B}bin@{b}), @{B}GEM@{b} (descriptor @{B}gem@{b}), @{B}IMG@{b} (descriptor @{B}img@{b}),

@{B}IND, DAT@{b} (descriptor @{B}ind@{b}), @{B}INF@{b} (descriptor @{B}inf@{b}), @{B}PRT, PRN@{b} (descriptor

@{B}prt@{b}), @{B}TXT, ASC, C, DBS, DOC, H, ICO, LST, RPT@{b} (descriptor @{B}txt@{b}). You

can include further filetypes into the allocation.

The syntax for this is: @{B}Filetype1; Filetype2;...=decriptor@{b}.



You have the option of designing your own icons for these and other

filetypes. The filenames must follow the following rules:

The first characters must match the identifiers named above: so, for

instance @{B}APP@{b} for executable programs. There follows either a @{B}1@{b} for a

monochrome icon, a @{B}4@{b} for a 16-colour icon or an @{B}M@{b} for the

mask. Thus the file @{B}APP1.IMG@{b} contains the monochrome icon, the file

@{B}APP4.IMG@{b} the colour icon and the file @{B}APPM.IMG@{b} the mask for the icon

for executable programs.

These files are quite normal @{B}IMG@{b} files. The graphics should have a

size of 16x16 pixels. The mask is always a monochrome graphic in which

all pixels must be black that on selection of the icon later are not

to be shown in inverse video.

The IMG files must be stored in the same folder as SYSTEM.INF.



Under @{B}[System]@{b} there are two settings:

@{B}GetVolumeNames@{b} determines whether on launching Manager and

@{Designer ignore} the names of the connected drives should be asked for.

These then appear in PHOENIX's own fileselector-box for the purpose

of better identification. But if you are working with interchangeable

disk hard drives that, though connected, sometimes have no medium in

them, or when you work in a network in which all network drives are

not always accessible, then you should deactivate this option with

@{B}GetVolumeNames=0@{b}. Otherwise at program launch you would get an error

message for each inaccessible drive in the form 'Drive X does not

answer...' which you would have to acknowledge each time. By default

@{B}GetVolumeNames@{b} is switched on.

@symbol ari "AdaptBitmaps"



@{B}AdaptBitmaps@{b} is of interest to owners of graphics cards and MagiCMac

who work in more than 16 colours: If you assign the value @{B}1@{b} to

@{B}AdaptBitmaps@{b}, then on launching PHOENIX an adaptation of the internal

colour resources to the graphics card hardware being used will be

performed. This does, however, take a bit of time. If you use NVDI as

driver software for your graphics card, such adaptation is normally

not necessary. If the PHOENIX operating elements look strange after

the launch of the program, then it is imperative that you set this

value to @{B}1@{b}.

@symbol ari "GDOSmaxDevice"



With @{B}GDOSmaxDevice@{b} you can set the highest number of the GDOS device

driver that PHOENIX is to take into account. The preset is 100.

A restriction may be sensible because, for instance, I find that with

the STemulator the device driver 62 (Memory driver) causes a crash.

In the sample file above PHOENIX would search through device drivers

21 to 40 inclusive for available drivers.
